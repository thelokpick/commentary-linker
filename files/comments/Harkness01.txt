Gallia omnis: Gaul as a whole. Gallia, 0» Gallia Transalpina, properly designates that part of the continent of Europe which lies west of the Alps and the Rhine, and north of the Pyrenees; but, as here used, it does not include the Roman province (provincia) in the southeastern portion of this district. In a still more restricted sense, Gallia is sometimes used to designate one of the three general divisions of this country, namely, that occupied by the Celtae or Galli. Gallia omnis distinguishes the country, as a whole, from this part.
est divisa: is divided\ not has been divided. H. 640, 3; LM. 1012; A. 291, b; G. 250, R. 2; (H. 550, N. 2).
quarum : partitive genitive, depending on unam = unam partem. H. 442; LM. 560; A. 216, a; G. 367; B. 201; (H. 397).
aliam: another, less definite than alteram, which would mean the second; aliam = aliam partem.
tertiam qui: =tertiam partem incolunt ii qui. H. 399, 4; LM. 823; A. 200, c; G. 621; B. 251, I; (H. 445, 6).
ipsorum lingua: ablative of means. H. 476; LM. 645; A. 248, c, i;
401; B. 218; (H. 420).
Celtae, Galli: predicate nominatives. Observe that the term Galli, like Gallia, is used in two senses. It usually denotes the inhabitants of Gaul as a whole, but it is often used, as in this instance, to designate the inhabitants of one division of the country, i.e. of Celtic Gaul. This distinction must be constantly borne in mind.
nostra: i.e. nostra lingua = lingua Latina. Caesar regularly writes in the third person, but he’often uses nos for Romani and noster for Latinus, Romanus, or Romanorum.
Hi ... lingua . .. differunt: the language of the Celtae was Celtic, that of the Belgae a Celtic dialect with some German elements, that of the Aquitani an Iberian dialect, of which the Basque, still spoken in a small district in the Pyrenees, is the modern representative.
lingua, institutis, legibus: ablatives of specification. Note carefully the distinction between this use of lingua and that just noticed in ipsorum lingua,

ipsi: they themselves, i.e. the Helvetii.
Eorum una pars: one part of their country, lit. one part of them. The name of a people or a pronoun referring to a people is sometimes thus used for the name of the country. Eorum, of them, for of their country; cf. Belgae oriuntur, pertinent, p. 58, 1. 4.
quam Gallos obtinere dictum est: which, it has been saidthe Gauls (i.e. the Celtic Gauls) occupy. Observe that Gallos is here used in the restricted sense of the word; see note on Celtae, Galli, line 3 above.
dictum est: give the subject H. 615; LM. 972; A. 329; G. 528, 2; B. 166, 1, b ; (H. 538).
continetur: it is bounded,\ lit. is held together.
Garumna flumine: what kind of an ablative? H. 476; LM. 645; A. 248, c, 1; G. 401; B. 218; (H. 420).
Page 56, line 1. — ab Sequanis: on the side of the Sequani, i.e. in their territory, lit. from the Sequani — a common Latin idiom, using a, ab, e, or ex, where our idiom requires at, in, on, on the side of, or some similar expression.
2. vergit ad septentriones: is situated toward the north, i.e. it lies to the north of the Roman province. This seems to be the meaning of Caesar’s words as interpreted by him in chapter 16, Gallia sub septentrionibus, ut ante dictum est, posita est.
Belgae ... oriuntur: here Belgae, the name of the people, suggests the country; see eorum una pars, p. 55,1. 17.
extremis, pertinent, spectant: these words are ter be interpreted from the Roman point of view, i.e. in their relation to the Roman province. Thus, extremis finibus, the farthest confines, means the northern boundary, the one most remote from the province.
Galliae: of Gaul, i.e. of Celtic Gaul; see note on Gallia omnis, p. 55,1. 1.
spectant: probably used in the same sense as vergit, as interpreted above.

The consuls Were joint presidents of the Roman commonwealth; they were two in number and held office fon one year.
regni: what kind of a genitive? Cf. regni cupiditas, a desire for (of) regal power, and regnum cupity he desires regal power. H. 440,2; LM. 571;
217; G. 363, 2; B. 200 ; (H.^356, III).

exirent: why in the plural?
perfacile esse . . . potiri: this is an instance of the indirect discourse, Oratio Obliqua, very common in Caesar. Remember that the leading clauses of the indirect discourse generally take the infinitive depending on some verb of saying, while all subordinate clauses take the subjunctive. Here esse depends on a verb of saying implied in persuasit; he persuaded them, etc., saying that it would be very easy, etc. The subject of esse is the clause, totius ... potiri, with which perfacile agrees as a predicate adjective. H. 394,4;
189, d; (H. 438, 3).
virtute: name another instance of an ablative of this kind, omnibus: H. 429; LM. 532; A. 228; G. 347; B. 187, III; (H. 386). praestarent: why in the subjunctive? H.598; LM.858; A.326; G.586;

magno dolore adficiebantur: were greatly pained. H. 476, 2; G. 401, R. 3; (H. 420, 2).	'
Pro: in proportion to, or simply for\
angustos: too narrow. qui: the antecedent is fines.
qui . . . patebant: this clause takes the indicative because it is the independent statement of Caesar, and not the thought of the Helvetii.
milia passuum CCXL, etc.: mille passuum is a little more than nine tenths of an English mile, which makes the length about 220 miles and the breadth about 160. Caesar’s estimate is, however, somewhat too high, resting doubtless on the exaggerated accounts of others.
milia: why accusative? H. 417; LM. 513; A. 257; G. 335: B. 181; (H. 379)-
This chapter furnishes illustrations of the distinction between the historical perfect, as in fuit> fecit, persuasit', and the imperfect, as in fiebat', adficiebantur, arbitrabantur, and patebant.

2. civitates: Gaul comprised a large number of petty states or clans.
ut occuparet: to seize; object clause of purpose; see note on ut... exirent, p. 57, 1. 4. The imperfect is explained by its connection with the historical present persuadet. The royal power (regnum) seems not to have been hereditary, but to have been conferred by the people or seized by ambitious chiefs; obtinuerat and occuparet illustrate the change of meaning which often takes place in the history of words. Obtineo, our word obtain, does not mean obtain, but hold\ occupy, while occupo, our word occupy, does not mean occupy, but seize.
Dumnorigi: construe with persuadet, below.
qui: refers to Dumnorigi.
principatum: note the difference in meaning between regnum, the kingly power and authority exercised by a recognized ruler, and principatus, the prominent position and influence of a leader. Dumnorix already holds the principatus among his people, and he is now urged to seize the regnum.

As the engagement with the Helvetii is the first regular battle described in the Commentaries, it may be interesting to the learner to trace the general course of the action. For two weeks Caesar had been following the Helvetii, with an interval of five miles between the head of his column and the rearguard of the enemy. One favorable opportunity for giving battle had been lost, through the mistake of Considius, as described in chapter 22.
In the meantime, the army supplies were nearly exhausted; Caesar, therefore, reluctantly turned the head of his column toward Bibracte, the chief city of the Haedui, where he would be sure to find an abundance of provisions. The Helvetii at once retraced their steps, and began to harass the rear guard of the Roman line. Thereupon Caesar withdrew his forces to a neighboring hill, and sent his cavalry to engage the enemy, while he placed his legions in battle array. It will be remembered that the Roman mode of attack required an elevated position from which the heavy javelins could be hurled into the ranks of the enemy with the greatest effect; see 106.
It will be observed that Caesar placed only his four veteran legions in line of battle, while the two legions recently enrolled in Cisalpine Gaul, and all the auxiliary infantry, were stationed in the rear.
In accordance with general custom, Caesar pitched his camp in the rear of his army, and proceeded at once to fortify it. The Helvetii had deposited their baggage at a convenient distance in the rear, and had placed their wagons in a circle around it — a common defense for a Gallic camp.
The Helvetii, in dense masses, advanced to the charge. The Roman legions were arranged in three lines. The front line received the onset of the enemy with a salvo of javelins, and then with drawn swords rushed to the

UNIVERSITY OF 10CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR
charge. After a few minutes, the second line of cohorts, advancing through the intervals of the first line, rushed into the thickest of the fight. The enemy were driven back to a hill a mile in the rear; but while the Roman legions were pursuing the retreating Helvetii, the Boii and Tulingi, fifteen thousand strong, who formed the rear guard of the enemy’s line of march, appearing on the scene, made an attack upon the right flank of the Roman line. The Helvetii, encouraged by this timely aid, turned upon their pursuers and renewed the battle. Caesar at once detached his third or rear line to receive the attack of the Boii and Tulingi, while with the other two lines he repulsed for the second time the whole force of the Helvetii.

This phalanx resembled the Roman testudo, as seen in plate VIII.

Lingonum: see Vocabulary and Map of Gaul.	—1
die quarto: in three days, lit. on the fourth day, probably including tne
day of the battle.
cum . . . non potuissent: subjunctive of cause. Note the order of thought: since our men had not been able to pursue them, as they had delayed (having delayed) three days, both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and for the burial of the dead. This long delay on the part of the Romans, for the reasons here assigned, seems to show that Caesar’s loss in this battle was very heavy.
Lingonas: the common Greek form in as is found in the accusative of the names of many Gallic tribes.
ne ... iuvarent... habiturum: the verb of saying on which this indirect discourse depends is implied in litteras ... misit.Pages 75, 76]	NOTES	—BOOK I, 25-28
eos: referring to the Helvetii.
qui si iuvisseot... habiturum: and if they should aid them, ■ he would regard them in the same light as the Helvetii; iuvissent represents the future perfect of the direct discourse, and habiturum the future.
eodem loco quo: locative ablatives; cf. nullis locis, p. 59,1. 22.
triduo intermisso: after an interval of three days. Notice the two meanings of intermitto, as illustrated in this expression and in itinere inter- misso, 1. 10.

Dum ea conquiruntur: Dum, while, is regularly followed by the historical present, generally best rendered by the English imperfect; ea, these, lit. these things. The use of the neuter, referring to obsides and servos, shows that they were regarded as the spoils of victory, rather than as men.
nocte intermissa: as night intervened, i.e. set in, Dum . • • conquiruntur.
timore perterriti ne: fearing that, lit. terrified with fear lest: perterriti by a construction according to sense takes the gender of the men constituting milia, with which we should expect it to agree.
ne supplicio adficirentur: that they would be visited with punishment. H. 567 with 4; LM. 897; A. 331,/; G. 550; B. 296, 2; (H.498, III).

Original from UNIVERSITY OF IOWACAESAR’S GALLIC WAR
si sibi . . . vellent: if they wished to be blameless in his sight, lit. in relation to him. In the direct discourse the indicative would be used in the condition; sibi, dative of relation. H. 425, 4; LM. 546; A. 235, b\ G. 353; B. 188, 2; (H. 384, 4, N. 3).
reductos: when they were brought back, referring to those who had fled; the object of habuit.

reliquos omnes in deditionem accepit: he accepted the surrender of all the rest; lit. received all the rest into, etc. They thus became subjects of Rome.
quo ... tolera»efif7>elative clause of characteristic, especially common after general negatives. H. 591; LM. 836; A. 320; G. 631, 2; B. 283; (H. 503, I).
ut copiam facerent: to furnish a supply.
ipsos . . . restituere iussit: observe that iussit takes the accusative and the infinitive, while imperavit above takes the dative and an ut clause, ipsos, themy emphatic, in distinction from Allobrogibus above.
quos incenderant: the indicative shows that Caesar has in mind the particular towns mentioned in chapter 5. The subjunctive would make the expression general — any towns which they had burned.
11. ea maxime ratione: principally for this reason, explained by quod noluit, etc.
noluit.. . locum ... vacare: what is the regular construction with volo, malot and nolo? H. 565, 2 ; LM. 965, 967; A. 331, b\ G. 546, r. 1 and 2; B. 331, IV, 296, 1, a; (H. 499, 2; 535, II).
Allobrogibusque: Caesar here makes special mention of the Allobroges, although they were included in the Province.
Boios: object of conlocarent; note the emphatic position.
Boios petentibus Haeduis . . . concessit: he granted the petition of the Haedui (lit. granted to the Haedui) that they might settle the Boii, etc. Here the construction is somewhat doubtful. Haeduis may be dative with concessit or in the ablative absolute, and ut . . . conlocarent may be the object either of petentibus or of concessit.
quod ... erant cogniti: Caesar evidently thinks that the Haedui wish to secure the aid of the Boii against their old rivals, the Sequani.
egregia virtute: men of remarkable courage; ablative of characteristic.

What historical facts have you learned from this chapter?
Original from UNIVERSITY OF IOWANOTES —BOOK I, 28, 29
Chapter 29. — tabulae: tablets. Among the Romans, tablets for writing ordinarily consisted of thin boards, joined by hinges and covered with wax on the inner surface. A sharp, metallic instrument, called stilus, served as a pen.
litteris Graecis confectae: written (made) in Greek characters. These Greek letters were undoubtedly derived from the Greek colony at Marseilles, in Southern Gaul.
nominatim ratio qui numerus, etc..: a full (by name) account, showing what number had left home ; an indirect question.
domo: from home.	H. 462,4; LM. 608; A. 258, a; G. 390, 2; B. 229,
b; (H. 412, 1).
qui . . . possent: relative clause of characteristic, potential subjunctive.
pueri, senes, mulieresque: subject of exissent, to be supplied from exisset above. On the use of que in mulieresque, observe that between three or more coordinate words the conjunction is, in general, either repeated or omitted altogether; but that que may be used with the last member of a series even when the conjunction is omitted between the other words, as in this instance.
Quarum ... summa erat capitum .. . CCLXIII: the sum of all these items was two hundred and sixty-three thousand Helvetii, lit. of heads of the Helvetii. The use of capita is common in the Ronujn census.
milium: predicate genitive with erat. H. 447; LM. 556; A. 214, c; G. 366; B. 198, 3; (H. 402).
Page 77, line 1.—ad: abou{; adverb.
fuerunt: agreeing with (he predicate noun milia, not with its subject Summa.
Eorum: probably depends upon censu, though some editors make it depend upon numerus, and treat milium as a predicate genitive.
censu habito: when an actual enumeration had been made> lit. had. Census is here used in this general sense. The same term, when applied to the Romans, often meant much more than this, including not only the numbering of the citizens, but also the valuation of property and a general review of the condition of the state. At Rome such a census was taken every five years.
ut . . . imperaverat: observe that ut meaning as is regularly followed by the Indicative, and ut meaning that by the subjunctive.
According to Caesar, what was the number of persons, men, women, and children, engaged in the Helvetian migration? How many of these survived the battle?CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR
War with Ariovistus, 30-54
Chapter ^p. — Bello Helvetiorum confecto: at the close of the Helvetian War. Notice the force of con, denoting completeness, thoroughness.
Galliae: here used in its limited sense, of Celtic Gaul.
gratulatum: supine denoting purpose; see rogatum, p. 63,1. 12.
8. Intellegere sese ... haberent: this long speech of the Gallic envoys is in the indirect discourse, depending on a verb of saying implied in gratulatum. We have already compared certain forms of indirect discourse with corresponding direct forms. It may now interest the student to see or to make more extended comparisons of direct and indirect forms. This speech of the Gallic envoys, if reported in the form of direct discourse, would read as
follows:
Intellegimus, tametsi pro veteribus Helvetiorum iniuriis populi Romani ab his poenas bello repetisti, tamen eam rem non minus ex usu terrae Galliae quam populi Romani accidisse, propterea quod eo consilio florentissimis rebus domos suas Helvetii reliquerunt, uti toti Galliae bellum inferrent imperioque potirentur locumque domicilio ex magna copia deligerent, quem ex omni Gallia opportunissimum ac fructuosissimum iudicassent, reliquasque civitates stipendiarias haberent.
In this passage the changes from the direct to the indirect discourse are fewer than usual. Intellegimus becomes intellegere sese, the infinitive with the subject sese expressed; repetisti becomes repetisset; reliquerunt becomes reliquissent. H. 643; LM. 1026; A. 336, 2; G. 650; B. 314, 1; (H. 524).
pro veteribus Helvetiorum iniuriis populi Romani: for the wrongs of long standing done by the Helvetii to the Roman people\ Helvetiorum is a subjective genitive, and populi an objective genitive.
his: refers to the Helvetii.
poenas: satisfaction.
repetisset: the subject, if expressed, would be a pronoun referring to Caesar.
eam rem accidisse: this had happened\ an infinitive clause depending on intellegere.
ex usu: to the advantage of lit. from use, very much like the English of use.
terrae Galliae: herg Galliae is in apposition with terrae.
eo consilio: with this design, explained by the clause of purpose, uti ... potirentur... haberent.
florentissimis rebus: ablative absolute, denoting either time or concession.
imperio, domicilio: explain cases.NOTES —BOOK I, 30, 31
14. ex magna copia: from the great abundance, i.e. of places which they would find in Gaul.
quem ... iudicassent: attracted into the subjunctive by deligerent; see commemorassent, p. 65,1. 16.
uti ... liceret: object clause of purpose, depending on Petierunt, sibi: construe with lipei;et.
concilium totius Galliae: Caesar's right to be consulted in this matter rests on the theory that might makes right.
sese . . . vellent:_indirecj discourse. Direct form as follows: Habemus quasdam res quas ex communi consensu abs te petere volumus; explain the changes.
ex communi consensu: with the common consent, i.e. with the consent of their people, lit. out of, implying that the action starts from (or grows out of) this consent.
21. inre iurando inter se sanxerunt: they mutually bound themselves by oath.
ne quis enuntiaret: object clause of purpose, depending on sanxerunt, nisi quibus... mandatum esset: except (lit. if not) those to whom it (that duty or office) should be'officially (communi consilio) assigned: man- datum esset, attracted into the subjunctive by enuntiaret/ cf. quem . . . iudicassent, above.
What effect did Caesar's victory have upon the Gallic chiefs? What request did they present to Caesar?
Chapter 31.—Eo concilio dimisso: this is the only intimation which Caesar has given us that the council was held.
qui ante fuerant: who had been with him before.
ad Caesarem: construe with reverterunt.
Page 78, line 2. — Caesari ad pedes: at the feet of Caesar. Caesari is a dative of relation; see sibi in si sibi .. . vellent, p. 76, 1. 2.
4. Non minus . . . viderent: indirect discourse depending on a verb of saying to be supplied. Direct form:
Non minus id contendimus et laboramus, ne ea quae dixerimus enuntientur, quam uti ea quae volumus impetremus, propterea quod, si enuntiatum erit, summum in cruciatum nos venturos videmus.
Compare this sentence with the corresponding sentence in Caesar. Note and explain all the changes which have taken place in the sentence in passing from the direct discourse to the indirect.
id: the object of contendere, explained by the object clause of purpose, ne ea... enuntiarentur, in apposition with it.CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR
5. dixissent, enuntiatum esset: remember that the future perfect in a subordinate clause of the direct discourse is changed in the indirect into the pluperfect subjunctive after an historical tense; see note on constituisset, z, luisset, p. 65,1. 3.
Galliae totius factiones esse duas: the long speech of Diviciacus, occupying the rest of the chapter, is in the indirect discourse.
In this speech, as indeed in all indirect discourse, the student should observe especially the use of moods — the infinitive in principal clauses, unless interrogative or imperative, and the subjunctive in subordinate clauses. But he should remember that the subjunctive in a subordinate clause, which would require that mood in the direct discourse, should be referred to the rule which would govern it in the direct discourse. Thus enuntiarentur and impetrarent, in the sentence, Non minus ... viderent, 1. 4, are both subjunctives of purpose, in the direct as well as in the indirect form, and should be so treated.
Galliae totius ... numerum: Direct discourse:
Galliae totius factiones sunt duae; harum alterius principatum tenent Haedui, alterius Arverni. Hi cum tantopere de potentatu inter se multos annos contenderent, factum est uti ab Arvernis Sequanisque Germani mercede arcesserentur. Horum primo circiter milia xv Rhenum transierunt; posteaquam agros et cultum et copias Gallorum homines feri ac barbari adamarunt, traducti sunt plures; nunc sunt in Gallia ad centum et viginti milium numerum.
Compare this passage with the corresponding passage in Caesar; note and explain all differences.
Galliae: only Celtic Gaul is meant.
Hi: these, i.e. the Haedui and their party on the one hand and the Averni with theirs on the other.
Hi cum ... multos annos contenderent: idiomatic use of the imperfect, best rendered by the pluperfect; compare this with the corresponding use of the imperfect indicative. H. 535; LM. 738; A. 277, b; G. 234; B. 260, 4; (H. 469, 2).
factum esse: it came to pass; the subject is the substantive clause of result, uti... arcesserentur.
Arvernis Sequanisque: the Arverni and the Sequani were united in their opposition to their common rival, the Haedui.
mercede: ablative of means.
Horum: of these, i.e. of the Germans; partitive genitive.
circiter: about; adverb.

22. fractos, qui: the antecedent of qui, implied in fractos, is the subject of coactos esse.
populi Romani hospitio atque amicitia: for almost three quarters of a century the Haedui had been allies and friends of the Roman people. Hospitium between two independent states denotes the relation of host and guest, requiring that each should extend to the other the rites of hospitality in the persons of their representatives and ambassadors; amicitia is a still stronger bond, requiring each state to adopt a friendly policy wherever the interests of the other are concerned; societas, a definite alliance, is the strongest bond that can exist between states.

30. Unum se esse ... teneretur: Direct discourse:
Unus ego sum ex omni civitate Haeduorum qui adduci non potuerim ut iurarem aut liberos meos obsides darem. Ob eam rem e* civitate profugi et Romam ad senatum veni auxilium postulatum, quod solus neque iure iurando neque obsidibus tenebar.
Compare this passage with the corresponding passage in Caesar; note and explain differences.
31* potuerit: subjunctive of characteristic.
Romam . . .venisse: this was in the year 61 B.c. Diviciacus was kindly received, but no aid was granted at the time.
quod ... teneretur: who assigns this reason? Note that obsidibus without ab is simply an ablative of means, not of agent.
Page 79, line 1. — Sed peius victoribus... pararentur: write this out in the direct form.

Paucis annis omnes ex Galliae finibus pellentur atque omnes Germani Rhenum transibunt; neque enim conferendus est Gallicus cum Germanorum agro neque haec consuetudo victus cum illa comparanda.
Compare this with the corresponding sentence in Caesar; note and explain changes. Observe that the future passive indicative pellentur becomes in the indirect discourse the periphrastic future passive infinitive, futurum esse uti pellerentur. H. 619, 2; LM. 984; A. 288,/; G. 248; B. 270, 3; (H. 537. 3)-
paucis annis: in a few years; ablative of time in which. H. 487; LM. 631; A. 256; G. 393; B. 231; (H. 429).
neque enim . . . neque: for neither .. . nor.
conferendum, comparandam: give the literal meaning of each. Do you regard them as synonyms here? If so, what is the idea which they have in common, and what is the distinction between them?
Gallicum cum Germanorum agro : the Gallic land (soil) with the German. This is another good illustration of the fact that adjectives and the genitives of nouns are kindred forms, which are often interchanged; see also sua omni- umque salute, p. 78, 1. I, and auctoritate sua atque exercitus, p. 79, 1. 29.
hanc consuetudinem victus: this our mode of lifet lit. this, i.e. the one near the speaker, or belonging to him, referring to the mode of life in Gaul, while ilia refers to that of the Germans.

Si quid mihi a Caesare opus esset, ego ad eum venissem (venturus eram); si quid ille me vult, ilium ad me venire oportet. Praeterea ego neque sine exercitu in eas partes Galliae venire audeo quas Caesar possidet, neque exercitum sine magno commeatu atque molimento in unum locum contrahere possum. Mihi autem mirum videtur quid in mea Gallia, quam bello vici, aut Caesari aut omnino populo Romano negotii sit.
Compare this with the form in Caesar; note and explain differences.
si. . . esset ... fuisse: condition contrary to fact; conclusion belonging to past time; hence venturum fuisse; cf. si .. . fuisset, non fuisse, etc., p. 65,

in eas partes, etc.: Ariovistus was at this time a long distance from Caesar, probably in the territory of the Triboci, who occupied the district in which Strasburg is now situated.
commeatu: commeatus means literally a going to and fro, but in Caesar it usually means supplies, provisions. What is the connection between these two meanings?
in . . . locum: why not in uno loco ?
mirum: agreeing with the indirect question, quid . . . esset, which is the subject of videri.
quid: construe with negotii.
vicisset: represents the perfect indicative of the direct discourse, because Ariovistus in his pride would be sure to emphasize the fact of his victory; explain mood; see fecissent’, p. 81, 1. 8.
Caesari: what kind of a dative? By what case should such datives be rendered?
What subjunctives have you noticed in this chapter?
What do you think of the reply which Ariovistus made to Caesar’s envoys?

UNIVERSITY OF IOWAmeo rex atque amicus a senatu appellatus sit, hanc mihi populoque Romano gratiam refert, ut in conloquium venire invitatus gravetur neque de communi re dicendum sibi et cognoscendum putet, haec sunt quae ab eo postulo: primum, ne quam multitudinem hominum amplius trans Rhenum in Galliam traducat; deinde obsides quos habeat ab Haeduis reddat Sequanisque permittat ut quos illi habeant voluntate eius reddere illis liceat; neve Haeduos iniuria lacessat, neve his sociisque eorum bellum inferat.
Compare this with the form in Caesar; note and explain differences.
Quoniam: construe with referret.
Quoniam ... referret and cum ... appellatus esset: explain these subjunctives, but observe that though they are both in causal clauses they are not to be explained in the same way.
tanto SUO . . . adfectus: after he had been treated with so great kindness by him (Caesar) and the Roman people, lit. with his so great kindness, etc.
cum ... appellatus esset: explains suo .. . beneficio.
in consulatu suo: i.e. in the preceding year, 59 b.c.
hanc gratiam: such a requital as this, explained by the clause, ut . . . gravaretur ... putaret.
gratiam referret: gratiam referre means to return or requite a favor; gratiam habere, to have or feel gratitude, to be grateful; gratiam ageret to express gratitude, to thank.

Si id ita .. . non neglecturum: write this sentence in the form which it would take in the direct discourse.Si . .. fecisset. . . futuram: conditional sentence of the first form, with the future perfect in the condition in the direct discourse, and the future in the conclusion; sibi, dative of possessor, refers to Caesar.
si non impetraret, sese ... se... non neglecturum: note that impetraret and neglecturum both represent the future indicative of the direct discourse; sese, repeated in the form of se after the long parenthesis, quoniam . .. defenderet, is the subject of the infinitive neglecturum.
Messala .. . consulibus: see note on the same, p. 57,1. 2.
 censuisset: had decreed\	As this verb involves purpose, it takes a purpose clause as its object, uti... defenderet.
quicumque . . . obtineret: whoever should hold Gaul as his province.
quod commodo . . . posset: so far as he could do it consistently with the interests of the state; a restrictive clause. H. 591, 3; LM. 841; A. 320, d\ G. 627, R. i; B. 283, 5; (H. 503, N. 1).

When was Ariovistus called king and friend by the Roman senate? What conditional promise does Caesar here make to Ariovistus, and what conditional threat does he add?
21. Chapter 36. — Ius esse ... impediri: Direct:
Ius est belli ut qui vicerunt iis quos vicerunt quem ad modum velint imperent; item populus Romanus victis non ad alterius praescriptum, sed ad suum arbitrium imperare consuevit. Si ego populo Romano non praescribo quem ad modum suo iure utatur, non oportet me a populo Romano in meo iure impediri.
ut. . . imperarent: substantive clause with the potential subjunctive, subject of esse; cf. futurum ut. . . haberet, p. 62,1. 20. H. 571, 2; LM. 902; A. 332; G. 557; B. 297, 3; (H. 501, 2).

30. Haeduis se . . . afuturum: Direct discourse:
Haeduis ego obsides non reddam neque his neque eorum sociis iniuria bellum inferam, si in eo manebunt quod convenit stipendiumque quotannis pendent; si id non fecerint, longe iis fraternum nomen populi Romani aberit.

Quod sibi . . . possent: write these sentences in the direct discourse.
Quod sibi, etc.: as to Caesar's threat, lit. as to this that Caesar threatened him, etc. Quod is an adverbial accusative.

7. congrederetur: he might come on, a volitive subjunctive in the direct discourse.
quid . . . possent: what the invincible Germans . . . could accomplish by their valor ; quid, cognate accusative with possent; lit. what power they had.

What was the complaint of the Haedui? What of the Treveri?
Chapter 38. — viam: cognate accusative.
ad occupandum Vesontionem : gerundive, expressing purpose, a common idiom.
quod: why neuter? H. 396, 2; LM. 826; A. 195, d; G. 614, R. 3; B. 250, 3; (H. 445» 4)»
a suis finibus, etc.: when these tidings ivere received, Caesar supposed Ariovistus to be quite as near Vesontio (Besan^on) as he was himself. Hence the great need of haste.
Id: this, emphatic, i.e. the occupation of Vesontio by Ariovistus.
magnopere . . . praecavendum: that he (sibi) ought to take every precaution.
ad bellum usui: of (for) use in (to) war. What kind of a dative is usui?
Page 84, line 1.— facultas, facultatem: compare meanings in these two passages.

ut. . . circumductum: as if traced by a pair of compasses : circumductum agrees with flumen, not with Dubis.
5. spatium: object of continet.
pedum sescentorum: predicate genitive of characteristic; see erat . . . milium, p. 76,1. 25; amplius has no effect on the case. The actual distanceNOTES —BOOK I, 37-39

'9. cum . . . laturos: indirect discourse; give the direct.
cum . . . iussisset: this temporal clause marks the time of fore and laturos, not of nuntiabant; iussisset represents the future perfect of the direct discourse.
castra moveri, signa ferri: the usual military terms, to break camp, to advance.
What synonyms have we noticed in connection with this chapter? What caused the panic in Caesar’s army? With whom did it begin?
Chapter 40.—omnium ordinum: of all ranks. To this council all the centurions were invited, though in an ordinary council of war only those of the first rank (primorum ordinum) were entitled to a place.
incusavit: incusare means to censure, find fault with; accusare, to accuse, prefer an accusation, as in a court of justice.
quod . • • putarent: Caesar’s reason at the time of the censure; hence the subjunctive.
quam in partem: in what direction.
sibi quaerendum: that it was necessary for them to inquire.
Ariovistum se . . . desperarent: Direct discourse:
Ariovistus me consule cupidissime populi Romani amicitiam appetiit; cur hunc tam temere quisquam ab officio discessurum iudicet? Mihi quidem persuadetur cognitis meis postulatis atque aequitate condicionum perspecta eum neque meam neque populi Romani gratiam repudiaturum. Quod si furore atque amentia impulsus bellum intulerit, quid tandem vereamini? aut cur de vestra virtute aut de mea diligentia desperetis?

Sibi persuaderi: that he was persuaded, lit. it was persuaded to him; eum ... repudiaturum is the subject of the impersonal persuaderi.

si intulisset: a condition of the first form with the future perfect in the direct form. Explain mood and tense here.Pages 85, 86]	NOTES	—BOOK I, 39, 40
amentia: amentia denotes a want of reason, as in an idiot; dementia, a perversion of reason, as in a madman.
22. quid . . . vererentur: compare cur . . . iudicaret', 1. 17.
sua: their; ipsius, his, lit. of himself, referring to Caesar, used instead of sua, which would be ambiguous here.
2 3- diligentia: not diligence, but care, watchfulness.
Factum eius hostis ... sublevarent: observe that the changes which have occurred in this sentence in passing from the direct to the indirect form have been very slight. Factum probably represents factum est; accepissent represents acceperant, sublevarent, sublevabant.
Factum . . . periculum: that this enemy had been tested\ lit. a trial of this enemy had been made. Factum for factum esse.
cum . . . videbatur: when the army appeared to have deserved no less praise than the commander himself etc. This use of the imperfect indicative with cum is the only example of the kind in the Gallic War, and here it stands in the midst of a long passage of indirect discourse. Its use is perhaps explained by the twofold fact that videbar with the infinitive is sometimes nearly equivalent to the subjunctive of the dependent verb, and that Caesar wished to emphasize as strongly as possible the fact stated in the temporal clause.
Cimbris . . . pulsis: these victories of Marius, so important for the safety of Rome, were gained in the years 102 and 101 B.c.
servili tumultu: during the revolt of the slaves, under Spartacus, 73- 71 B.C. Tumultus is properly a revolt, insurrection, civil war.
quos tamen . . . sublevarent: render passively, who yet were somewhat aided by, etc. The antecedent of quos is implied in servili, during the revolt of the slaves; aliquid: somewhat; adverbial accusative.
Ex quo . . . potuerint: Direct discourse:
Ex quo iudicare potest quantum habeat in se boni constantia, propterea quod, quos aliquamdiu inermes sine causa timuistis, hos postea armatos ac victores superavistis.
Denique hi sunt idem Germani quibuscum saepenumero Helvetii congressi, non solum in suis, sed etiam in illorum finibus, plerumque superarunt, qui tamen pares esse nostro exercitui non potuerunt.
Page 86, line 1. — quantum . . . constantia: how much virtue there is in resolution, lit. how much of good resolution has in itself.
2. inermes, armatos ac victores: though (when) unarmed, etc. At first the insurgents were to a large extent without arms, but they subsequently obtained arms and gained many victories. They were finally defeated by Crassus, 71 B.c.CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR
hos: these, i.e. these with Ariovistus.
quibuscum . . . superarint: render in two clauses, whom the Helvetii had often met and generally defeated, not only, etc., lit. with whom the Helvetii having often met, etc. illorum refers to the Germans.

16. Qui suum . . . iudicaturos: Direct discourse r
Qui suum timorem in rei frumentariae simulationem angustiasque itineris conferunt, faciunt arroganter, cum aut de officio imperatoris desperare aut praescribere videantur. Haec mihi sunt curae; frumentum Sequani, Leuci, Lingones subministrant, iamque sunt in agris frumenta matura; de itinere ipsi brevi tempore iudicabitis.
Qui suum timorem . . . conferrent: those who ascribed their own fear to a pretended anxiety about supplies, etc.
de officio . . . praescribere: to despair of the fidelity of their commander or to dictate to him.
sibi esse curae: explain both datives; see Gallis magno • . • impedi- mento, p. 74.1. 6.
frumentum, frumenta: note the well-known distinction between frumentum, the general word for corn, grain, and the plural, frumenta, grain standing in the field; see frumenta, frumento, p. 67,11. 2-4.
iamque esse . .. matura: it was probably about the middle of August.
23- Quod non fore . . . esse perspectam: write this in the direct form.
Quod . . . dicantur: as to the statement that they (the soldiers) would

avarice had been proved against them). Caesar’s view is, that armies mutiny only when their commanders have been unsuccessful or guilty of crime.
27. suam innocentiam: his integrity, blamelessness, freedom from avarice, as opposed to avaritiam. Note the emphatic position of suam, contrasting his integrity with their avarice. Observe carefully Caesar’s argument: mutinies occur only when the commander has been unsuccessful or guilty of avarice; his freedom from avarice was known to all, and they themselves had seen his wonderful success in the Helvetian war. What, then, was the conclusion?
Itaque se, etc.: write the rest of the chapter in the direct discourse.
se quod .. . repraesentaturum: he would do at once what he had intended
to defer, etc.
de quarta vigilia: see note on de tertia vigilia, p. 64,1. 6.

461; B. 162, 4; (H. 353» O*
sequatur, iturum: both represent the future indicative of the direct discourse. Explain tense of sequatur.
Page 87, line 1. — decima legione: this was Caesar’s favorite legion, so famous for discipline and courage.
2. praetoriam cohortem: praetorian cohort, or body guard. The select band which attended the person of the commander was called the praetorian cohort.
This remarkable speech, one of the most famous recorded in ancient history, wrought a marvelous change in the feelings of the disheartened and terrified soldiers. What does Caesar say about Ariovistus? What about the Germans? What about supplies? What does he propose to do in view of this sudden panic?
Chapter 41. — mentes: is used, rather than animi, to show that their judgments were convinced.
innata est: agrees with cupiditas, not with the compound subject.
princeps: see note on princeps poenas persolvit, p. 64, 1. 18. Here prima
would, of course, be somewhat objectionable before the ordinal decima.
ei gratias egit: returned thanks to him ; see note on gratiam referret, p. 82,1. 3»
quod . . . fecisset: who assigns this reason?
cum tribunis . . . egerunt: arranged with the tribunes, etc.

Ariovistus, whom Caesar wished to meet, was in the valley of the Rhine. The direct route would lead over the northern part of the Jura chain, but Caesar preferred a circuitous route through the open country.
Septimo die: we must not suppose that Caesar marched only fifty miles in these seven days. The circuit of fifty miles brought him around the mountains into the direct road, but it formed only a part of the distance.
a nostris: from ours, i.e. from our forces.
What effect did Caesar’s speech have on the soldiers?
Chapter 42. — Quod . . . existimaret: write this in the direct discourse.

alia ratione: on any other terms ; ablative of cause.
interposita causa tolli: to be prevented by a mere pretext\ i.e. he did not wish to give Ariovistus any excuse for declining an interview.
Gallorum equitatui: remember that Caesar’s cavalry consisted entirely of foreigners, chiefly of Gauls, but with a few Germans and Spaniards.
commodissimum: agreeing with the clause, eo legionarios ... imponere, which is the subject of esse.
equis . . . detractis: ablative absolute.
equitibus: dative with detractis. H. 429; LM. 534; A. 229; G. 347, r. 5; B. 187,11; (H. 386).

18. plus Caesarem facere : that Caesar was doing more, i.e. for that legion.
20. ad equum rescribere: that he was transferring them to the cavalry. Perhaps the wit of the remark consists in part in the pun involved in ad equum rescribere, which may mean either to transfer to the cavalry or to raise to the rank of knighthood.

Transisse Rhenum . . . pependerint: Direct discourse:
Transii Rhenum non mea sponte, sed rogatus et arcessitus a Gallis; non sine magna spe magnisque praemiis domum propinquosque reliqui: sedes habeo in Gallia ab ipsis concessas, obsides ipsorum voluntate datos; stipendium capio iure belli quod victores victis imponere consuerunt. Non ego Gallis, sed Galli mihi bellum intulerunt; omnes Galliae civitates ad me oppugnandum venerunt ac contra me castra habuerunt; eae omnes copiae a me uno proelio pulsae ac superatae sunt. Si iterum experiri volunt, ego iterum paratus sum decertare; si pace uti volunt, iniquum est de stipendio recusare quod sua voluntate ad hoc tempus pependerunt

Amicitiam populi Romani mihi ornamento et praesidio, non detrimento esse oportet, atque hac spe petii. Si per populum Romanum stipendium remittetur et dediticii subtrahentur, non minus libenter recusabo populi Romani amicitiam quam appetii.
 sibi ornamento: construction ? see Gallis . . . impedimento, p. 74,1. 6.
per populum: why not a populo ? Because the result here contemplated, stipendium remittatur, is not viewed as the proposed object of the Roman people, — an act performed by them as a voluntary agent,— but merely as brought about indirectly through their means. H. 468, 3; A. 246, b\ G. 401; (H. 415, 1, N. 1).

quod . . . interpellaremus: who assigns this reason? What mood and tense would be used in the direct discourse?
Quod fratres .. . pro hoste habiturum: Direct discourse:
Quod fratres a senatu Haeduos appellatos dicis, non tam barbarus neque tam imperitus sum rerum ut non sciam neque bello Allobrogum proximo Haeduos Romanis auxilium tulisse neque ipsos in his contentionibus quas Haedui mecum et cum Sequanis habuerunt (habuerint), auxilio populi Romani usos esse. Debeo suspicari simulata te amicitia quem exercitum in Gallia habes mei opprimendi causa habere. Tu nisi decedes atque exercitum deduces ex his regionibus, ego te non pro amico, sed pro hoste habebo.
imperitum rerum: ignorant of affairs. Construction of rerum ? see rei militaris, p. 71,1. 8.

interfecerit: represents the future perfect of the direct discourse.
gratum esse facturum: he would do a favor; probably not an empty boast, as Caesar had many political foes among the nobles.
id se .. . compertum habere: that he had ascertained this, etc. Note the expression compertum habere.
per eorum nuntios: if Ariovistus speaks the truth, the nobles must have had their agents in Gaul.
quorum: the antecedent is nobilibus principibusque.
Quod si . . . discessisset: but if he would withdraw.
sine ullo eius labore: without any effort on his (Caesar’s) part.
What do you think of the speech of Ariovistus? What claim does he make? What does he say about the friendship of the Romans? What offer does he make to Caesar?

neque in provinciam redegisset: Caesar evidently cites this as an illustration of generosity on the part of Rome, but policy, as well as generosity, probably dictated the course adopted by the Romans on this occasion, as the Averni and the Ruteni dwelt beyond the Cevennes, and could not, therefore, be readily incorporated in the Roman province.
I7- Quod si antiquissimum quodque tempus, etc.: but if priority of time should always be regarded\ lit. every most ancient time. On the score of priority of time the Romans have the advantage by upwards of sixty

qua multa iam ... utebatur: which Ariovistus already spoke fluently; qua refers to linguae, and multa agrees with it, lit. which much,

selects his envoys. The bond of hospitium had such sanctity in ancient times that it was hoped that even Ariovistus would not dare to violate it.
His: the indirect object of mandavit. The clause, ut. •. cognoscerent ... referent, is the direct object.

23. Chapter 49. — ultra eum locum: the student will bear in mind the recent movements of the two armies. At the beginning of chapter 48 they were within six miles of each other.

aciem suam . . . circumdederunt, surrounded their line with wagons and carts. But circumdare means not only to surround, as in this example, but, also, to place around. It then takes the accusative of the object thus placed, with the dative of an indirect object, as, murum urbi circumdare, to place or build a wall around the city.
nequa: note form. H. 186; LM. 287; A. 105, d; G. 107, n. 2; B. 91, 2; (H. 190,1).

reliquos omnes: eighty thousand in number according to Plutarch.
9. Duae uxores: among the ancient Germans, polygamy seems to have been confined to the chieftains.
duxerat = in matrimonium duxerat: had married\ but in the line above duxerat means simply had brought,

victoria: H. 471, 1; LM. 617; A. 247, a; G. 644; B. 217, 2;

^proximi Rhenum: what other construction have you found with proximus? see proximi . . . Germanis, p. 55,1. 10; for the accusative, see H. 435, 2;
L 261, a; G. 359, N. 1; B. 141, 3; (H. 391, 2).
duobus bellis: i.e. the war with the Helvetii, and that with Ariovistus.
in hibema in Sequanos: into winter quarters among the Sequani. Here the Latin idiom requires in Sequanos, not in Sequanis, to designate the place into which the army was led.
The Romans paid great attention to the winter quarters of their armies. They not only fortified them very strongly, but also furnished them with many accommodations for the convenience and comfort of the soldiers.
citeriorem Galliam: also called Gallia Cisalpina, consisting of Gaul south of the Alps.
ad conventus agendos: to hold the assizes or courts. The Roman governors of provinces usually employed their time in winter in the civil duties "»f their office. They held courts, corrected abuses, levied taxes, and exercised
controlling influence over public affairs; but Caesar may have had an addi- .ional motive for spending the winter in his Cisalpine province. He doubtless wished to be as near Rome as possible that he might watch the movements of political parties, and thus be able to take advantage of any opportunity to promote his own ambitious designs.
How many legions did Caesar place in wrinter quarters? About how many men did those legions probably contain? In what part of Gaul were the winter quarters?
BOOK SECOND
Campaign of the Year 57 b.c.
War with the Belgae, I-33
Page 99, line 1, Chapter i. — Cum esset: remember that after cum the imperfect and pluperfect tenses are usually in the subjunctive. H. 600, II; LM. 858; A. 325; G. 585; B. 288; (H. 521, II).

litterisque . . . fiebat: and he was likewise repeatedly informed by the letters of Labienus. It will be remembered that Labienus had been left in charge of the winter quarters; see p. 98,1. 5.
omnes Belgas . . . has esse causas: this is an instance of the indirect discourse, oratio obliqua, very common in Caesar. It depends on certior fiebat, involving the idea of saying; see note on Caesarem certiorem faciunt\ p. 63, 1. 17. In the direct discourse this passage would stand thus:
Omnes Belgae, quam tertiam esse Galliae partem diximus, contra populum Romanum coniurant obsidesque inter se dant. Coniurandi hae sunt causae.
Compare this direct form with Caesar’s indirect discourse. By this method, it is hoped, you may most easily overcome the difficulties of the indirect discourse.
Belgas: is the subject of the infinitives coniurare and dare. H. 415; LM. 959 ; A. 240,/; G. 343, 2 ; B. 184; (H. 536).
Belgas quam . . . partem: the Belgae, whose country, etc. The name of a people, or a pronoun referring to a people, is sometimes thus used for the name of the country; quam is attracted from quos to agree with the predicate noun partem. H. 396, 2; LM. 826; A. 199; G. 614, R. 3; B. 250, 3; (H. 445» 4)-
tertiam partem: one of the three parts, not strictly a third part.
dixeramus: / (we) had said\ i.e. in the first chapter of the first book.
Coniurandi: of the conspiracy or confederacy. In Caesar’s view any agreement made by the Gauls for their protection against the Romans was a conspiracy.
primum ... sollicitarentur: indirect discourse. Direct thus:
Primum, quod verentur ne omni pacata Gallia ad se exercitus noster adducatur; deinde quod ab non nullis Gallis sollicitantur.
Compare this direct form with Caesar’s indirect discourse.
primum . . . adduceretur and deinde . . . sollicitarentur: these clauses explain causas and give the two reasons for the conspiracy or confederacy.
quod vererentur: causal clause, indirect discourse. H. 643; LM. 1026; A. 336, 2; G. 650; B. 314, 1; (H. 524).
ne ... adduceretur: object clause depending on vererentur. H. 567; LM. 897; A. 331,/; G. 550; B. 296, 2; (H. 498, III).
omni pacata Gallia: if all Gaul (i.e. Gaul in its restricted sense, Celtic Gaul) should be subdued, H. 489, I; LM. 640; A. 255; G. 410; B. 227; (H. 431, 2).
9. partim qui ... partim qui: some of whom . .. others of whom. The clauses introduced by partim qui and partim qui explain non nullis Gallis,NOTES —BOOK II, 1, 2
and designate the two classes of Gauls who were urging on the Belgae. Here observe that Caesar has dropped the indirect discourse, and is now stating facts on his own authority; hence the indicatives, noluerant, ferebant, and studebant.
ita .. .^moleste ferebant: so they were annoyed, etc., lit. bore it ill.
mobilitate, etc.: here, as elsewhere, Caesar refers to the fickle character of the Gauls; see IV, 5.

Compare this direct discourse with Caesar’s indirect form. Note and explain the changes.	'

Oppidis recipere: to receive him into their towns, lit. in (or by means of) their towns. H. 476, 3; LM. 628; A. 258,/; G. 389; B. 218, 7; (H. 425,1).
1 a cis Rhenum: on this side of the Rhine, i.e. the southern or Gallic side, on which several German tribes had settled.

Examine carefully the indirect discourse contained in this chapter. Note the fact that all the verbs are either in the infinitive or in the subjunctive. Is this usual in indirect discourse?
Notice again that the principal clauses of the indirect discourse take the infinitive, with a subject expressed or implied, and that all the other clauses take the subjunctive. Are all these subjunctives to be explained in the same way? Compare and explain utantur and potuerint. How many of these subjunctives represent the subjunctive in the direct discourse? All such subjunctives are to be explained, not by the indirect discourse, but by the principles which would apply to them in the direct discourse.
Chapter 4. — Cum . . . quaereret: see cum esset, p 99,1. 1, and cum . . . venisset, p. ioi, 1. I, and note with what frequency Caesar uses cum with the subjunctive.
ab his: i.e. from the envoys of the Remi.
quae . . . essent. . . possent: indirect questions. H. 649, II; LM. 810; A. 334; G. 467; B. 300; (H. 529,1).

sic reperiebat: sic is explained by the rest of the sentence, Plerosque ... sumerent, which is also the object of reperiebat. This in the direct form would stand thus:
Plerique Belgae sunt orti ab Germanis Rhenumque antiquitus traducti propter loci fertilitatem ibi consederunt Gallosque qui ea loca incolebant expulerunt, solique sunt qui patrum nostrorum memoria omni Gallia vexata Teutonos Cimbrosque intra suos fines ingredi prohibuerint; qua ex re fit uti earum rerum memoria magnam sibi auctoritatem magnosque spiritus in re militari sumant.
Compare this with Caesar’s indirect discourse.
ab Germanis: why is ab used? H. 469, 1; LM. 609; A. 244, r.; G. 395; B. 215, 2; (H. 415, II, n.).
Rhenum: H. 413; LM. 501; A. 239, 2, 6; G. 331, R. I; B. 179; (H. 376).
ibi: i.e. in Gaul.
22. qui . . . prohibuerint: for tense, see ut . . . potuerint, p. 101,1. 12; for mood, H. 591, 5; LM. 838; A. 320, b\ G. 631, 1; B. 283, 2; (H. 503, 1).
Original from UNIVERSITY OF IOWACAESAR’S GALLIC WAR
patrum: subjective genitive. H. 440, 1; LM. 553; A. 213, 1; G. 364; B. 199; (H. 396, II).
memoria: in the time. H. 486; LM. 630; A. 256; G. 393; B. 230; (H. 429).
Teutonos Cimbrosque: the event here referred to belongs to the latter part of the second century B.C., when the Teutones and the Cimbri, brave and warlike barbarians from the north, invaded Southern Europe.
uti . . . sumerent: substantive clause, subject of fieri. H. 571,1; LM. 902; A. 332, a, 2; G. 553, 3; B. 297, 2; (H. 501,1, 1).
Compare this example of indirect discourse with that noticed in the last chapter. What moods do you find in each? Remember, however, that a subjunctive in a subordinate clause which would require that mood in the direct discourse should be referred to the law which would govern it in that discourse. Thus prohibuerint is a potential subjunctive in a relative clause of result in the direct as well as in the indirect form, and should be so treated. Thus, too, sumerent is in the subjunctive, not because it is in the indirect discourse, but because it is a potential subjunctive in a substantive clause of result, which is the subject of fieri; but incolerent is in the subjunctive simply because it is in the indirect discourse, as the indicative would be used in the direct discourse.
earum . . . memoria: remembering these things, or because of their recollection of these things. H. 475; LM. 612; A. 245; G. 408; B. 219; (H. 416).
De numero . . . quod . . . possidere: indirect discourse, depending on dicebant. Direct:
De numero eorum omnia habemus explorata, propterea quod propinqui-, tatibus adfinitatibusque coniuncti quantam quisque multitudinem in communi Belgarum concilio ad id bellum pollicitus sit cognovimus.
Plurimum inter eos Bellovaci et virtute et auctoritate et hominum numero valent; hi possunt conficere armata milia centum, polliciti ex eo numero electa milia sexaginta totiusque belli imperium sibi postulant. Suessiones nostri sunt finitimi; fines latissimos feracissimosque agros possident.
Compare this direct discourse with the corresponding passage in Caesar; note and explain differences.
omnia se habere explorata: that they had ascertained everything; explorata agrees with omnia. H. 431, 3; LM. 1018; A. 292, c; G. 238; B. 337, 6; (H. 388, 1. N.).

7. Chapter 25. — Caesar: subject of processit and iussit. Caesar here resumes from p. 115, L 7, the account of the part which he himself took in the battle.
Caesar ... ubi... vidit... processit ... iussit ... possent: this is a remarkable instance of a Latin period, but it gives a graphic picture of the crowded and confused battle scene which it is intended to portray. The independent clause of the sentence is as follows: Caesar . .. profectus, scuto .. • detracto ... processit centurionibusque ... iussit. .. possent; while the dependent or subordinate clause is ubi . . . vidit ... in angusto vidit ... posset, which is expanded to a remarkable length by the insertion of several instances of the accusative and the infinitive, and of the ablative absolute. In translating such a sentence the student should not attempt, to render it

literally, and yet he should follow the Latin construction as closely as the English idiom will permit. Considerable liberty may be taken with the long subordinate clause, ubi . . . posset. This may be broken up into three or four similar clauses by repeating the words where he saw, or simply he saw, and some of the ablatives absolute may be rendered by clauses with that. For a poetical translation of a part of this sentence, see Longfellow’s “Courtship of Miles Standish,” II.
ab . . . cohortatione: after exhorting the tenth legion.
8. profectus: went, lit. having gone. As the main verb, processit, is so far removed from the subject, the English is improved by rendering profectus by a verb.

urgeri, esse: these infinitives and several others depend on vidit.

signo amisso: the loss of a standard was regarded as a great disgrace.
primipilo: the chief centurion; ablative with confecto. The primipilus, as the chief centurion of the legion, was intrusted with the eagle or standard of the legion; see 81.

According to Caesar’s account, the Germans were guilty of the basest violation of good faith.

Page 156, line 1. — opinionem eius exercitus: the reputation of his (Caesar’s) army.
9. Chapter 17.—tutum esse . . . dignitatis esse: tutum is predicate adjective with esse, and dignitatis predicate genitive with esse.
suae .. . dignitatis esse: to be consistent with his own dignity or that of the Roman people.
proponebatur: was clearly seen, lit. was set before him.
id Sibi contendendum: that he must attempt it. He accordingly proceeded to bridge the Rhine, probably near Bonn, possibly higher up the river, near Neuwied.
Tigna bina sesquipedalia: two piles each a foot and a half thick. Tigna is the object of iungebat. The distributive bina is used because there were several pairs.
dimensa ad altitudinem, etc.: adapted to the depth of the river. The longest piles would, of course, be needed in the deepest water.
‘16. intervallo . . . iungebat: this means that the two piles were made fast to each other, but were at the same time kept two feet apart; see plan in the text.
17. Haec cum ... adegerat: when, by means of machines, he had let these down into the water, had secured them there, and had driven them down with rammers.
Original from UNIVERSITY OF IOWANOTES — BOOK IV, 16, 17
non sublicae . . • perpendiculum: not like (in the manner of) an
ordinary pile, vertically.
secundum . . . fluminis : according to the current (nature) of the river, i.e. down the stream.
iis contraria: opposite to these; contraria agrees with tigna, to be supplied after duo = bina; duo is admissible in this instance, because the meaning is perfectly clear from bina, in 1. 14 above.
intervallo pedum .. . parte: at the distance of forty feet at the lower end (ab inferiore parte).
contra vim . . . conversa: turned against the force and current of the river ; see plan in text.
Haec utraque: these tivo pairs.
quantum ... distabat: which was the distance between the piles, i.e. the interval between the two piles was two feet, and accordingly a beam two feet thick (bipedalis) was let in between them, and connected this pair of piles with the opposite pair, forty feet lower down the river.
binis utrimque fibulis: with two ties on either side, i.e. at each end of the beam. The exact meaning of fibula as here used is still in dispute. Various interpretations have been suggested by different writers, as by Napoleon III, Kraner, Rheinhardt, August von Goler, and others. The interpretation adopted in these notes was probably first suggested and advocated by Colonel August von Cohausen, of the Prussian Corps of Engineers, in an elaborate and carefully prepared work on this bridge. Lieutenant F. Zimmerhaeckel, in a special treatise, recently published by Teubner, Leipzig, accepts the view of von Cohausen. Von Goler gives the same meaning to fibula, but his method of attaching it to the piles is more elaborate, requiring some nice work on the part of the joiner.
quibus disclusis . . . revinctis: as these (i.e. the two opposite pairs of piles) 7vere kept apart, and also secured in the opposite direction : quibus disclusis relates to what has already been described in haec utraque distinebantur. The two pairs of piles, inclining toward each other, were prevented from inclining too far by the cross pieces or fibulae, inserted in the two acute angles which the large connecting beam made with those piles. The action implied by in contrariam partem revinctis has not been described, but it may mean simply that, while the two pairs of piles are kept apart by the fibulae, they are yet inseparably bound together by the large connecting beams, and by the whole structure and weight of the bridge.
30. Haec ... . contexebantur: these were connected by timbers placed in the direction of the length of the bridge. This was a trestle bridge. Caesar, having now described one trestle, supporting one section of the bridge, leaves us to infer that all the trestles were constructed in the same way. He now
Original from UNIVERSITY OF IOWACAESAR’S GALLIC WAR
proceeds to show how these trestles were connected, and how the bridge was covered.
31. sublicae ... oblique agebantur: strong piles (sublicae) are driven obliquely into the bed of the river below the bridge, as a further support against the force of the stream. These are connected with the main timbers of the trestle work, as seen in the plan in the text.
Page 157, line 2. — quae .. . exciperent: relative clause of purpose.
pro ariete : as a buttress.
3. aliae {sublicae) ... supra pontem mediocri spatio: these piles above the bridge, probably not connected with it, were intended to protect it in the manner described in the text. The brevity of Caesar’s description leaves us in doubt whether the several sections of the bridge were protected by single piles or by groups of three or more, as represented in the plan.
7. Chapter 18. — Diebus: construe with traducitur.
quibus . . . comportari: after (lit. in which) the timber begafi to be collected.
quos ex Tencteris: this refers to the cavalry which had taken refuge among the Sugambri; see p. 154, 11. 12-16.
16. in solitudinem: note in with the accusative, though our idiom would lead us to expect the ablative; but in Latin abdere is often thus treated as a verb of motion.
Chapter 19. — si . . . premerentur: indirect clause, depending on pollicitus, having promised that he would give them, etc., if they should, etc.
Suebos . .. constituisse: indirect discourse, in apposition with haec. Write it in the direct form and note changes.
uti . . . demigrarent: clause of purpose; imperative in the direct form.
convenirent: this probably represents the present subjunctive, let... assemble.
Hunc esse . . . regionum: that this place had been selected near the center of those regions; medium = medium locum, governs regionum as a partitive genitive.
ibi decertare: there to fight the decisive battle.
iis rebus, etc.: having accomplished those objects for which, etc.: rebus is explained by the three clauses of purpose in apposition with it, viz. ut. .. iniceret, etc.
