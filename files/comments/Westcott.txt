z. Gallia: see map, frontispiece. The term Gallia, as here used, excludes Cisalpine Gaul and the Province, but includes most of the Netherlands, the country on the west bank of the Rhine, and much of Switzerland, and thus extends far beyond the limits of modem France.
est . . . divisa: is divided, not has been divided; this is not a true perfect tense, but a present, divisa being a predicate adjective ; W. 293 ; B. 337 ; A. 291. b ; H. 394. 1. When you look up a grammar reference be careful to notice the examples. They will often be of more help than the statement of a rule.
omnis : taken as a whole.
quarum: partitive genitive ; W. 355 ; B. 201.1; A. 216. a. 2 ; H. 440. 5.
unam : sc., partem. It is best in translating this sentence to change to the passive construction, in order to preserve more nearly the order and emphasis of the Latin; thus: One of which is inhabited by the Belgians, etc.
Belgae : the population of Gaul was much mixed even in Caesar’s day. Successive hordes of invaders of Celtic race and language had been coming into the country for several centuries, conquering the earlier inhabitants, intermarrying with them, and, except in the south, imposing their language upon them. These Celtic conquerors were a tall, fair race; the populations which preceded them were shorter and darker. The conquering race were most numerous in the northern part of Gaul, and were less modified by mixing with the earlier inhabitants. They were the latest comers and the least civilized of the Celts. But they were much mixed with German tribes in the northeast. See Bk. II, ch. I.
aliam : the second, lit. another.
Aquitani: Iberians, a short, dark people, living on both sides of the Pyrenees. They were but slightly mixed with the conquering Celtic race, and retained their own language.
qui: those who; the antecedent of qui is ei understood, the subject of incolunt.
Celtae : in the great central division of the country the population was more mixed than in Aquitania, and less purely Celtic than in Belgic Gaul. The language was Celtic, and the physical characteristics of the Celtic race were common enough to make a decided impression upon foreign observers.
Galli: the people of the great central division of Gaul—Gauls, in the narrower sense of the word.
lingua: ablative of specification; W. 396; B. 226; A. 253; H.

Germanis: dative wdth an adjective of nearness; W. 333; B. 192. 1 ; A. 234. a; H. 434. 2.
trans Rhenum: the Rhine has been for ages the historic boundary between the Gauls, or French, and the Germans.
continenter: adverb formed from the present participle of contineo. It is important to notice groups of*related words, and see how the same idea appears in different parts of speech. Compare in a lexicon the meanings of contineo, continens, continenter, continentia > continuus, contentus.
Qua de causa : For this reason ; W, 304. 2 ; B. 251. 6 ; A. 180. f\ H. 510. Note that a preposition of one syllable is apt to stand between its noun and the modifier of the latter.

CHAPTER 2

M. Messala [et] M. Pisone consulibus: the Romans designated a date by naming the consuls of the year in question. Translate: in the consulship of, etc. M'. = Marco. Notice hereafter that bracketed words are generally not to be translated; they are words which have crept into the text by mistakes in copying or otherwise. The year here designated is 61 B. C. The construction is ablative absolute, Messala (and) Piso being consuls. W. 397, 398 ; B. 227. I ; A. 255. a ; H. 489.
cupiditate : ablative of cause or means.

una ex parte: on one side; the order of words is like qua de causa, page 1, line 12 ; see note.
qui: agrees in gender not with flumine, but with Rhodano.
His rebus fiebat: thus it happened; the subject of fiebat is the clause ut. . . possent; W. 523 ; B. 297. 2 ; A. 332. a. 2 ; H. 571. 1.

Probably the real reason for this exodus of the Helvetians was the pressure of German nations behind them.

Subjugation of the Belgic Gauls. Learning that the Belgae, excepting the Remi, were forming a confederation against the Romans, Caesar takes the field and fortifies a camp on the Axona (Aisne) River, where he soon afterward inflicts a crushing defeat upon the allied Belgae. This is followed by the submission of the city of Noviodunum and the nations of the Bellovaci and Ambiani (ch. 1-15). When advancing against the Nervii, Caesar is suddenly attacked by them and their allies, and barely escapes defeat. After a desperate struggle the Nervii are beaten and almost annihilated (ch. 16-28). The Atuatuci surrender after a siege, but, acting treacherously, are sold into slavery (ch. 29-33). The campaign ends with the reduction of several tribes along the coast (ch. 34, 35).

BOOK THREE—B. C. 56
Conquest of Northwest and Southwest Gaul. Caesar’s lieutenant Galba, stationed in the Alps for the winter, is obliged by the hostility of the natives to withdraw (ch. 1-6). In the spring, Caesar proceeds against the tribes of Aremorica, in the northwest of Gaul. A tedious campaign against the Veneti, the principal nation of that region, is finally decided by a naval battle, after which the Veneti are severely punished for their resistance (ch. 7-16). Sabinus, another lieutenant, subdues the Venelli along the northern coast (ch. 17-19). Crassus conducts a successful expedition into Aquitania, resulting in the submission of most of that country (ch. 20-27). Caesar finishes the year’s campaign by laying waste the territory of the Morini and Menapii along the northern coast (ch. 28, 29).

First Expedition into Germany, ch. 1-19. Various German tribes having crossed the Rhine, and some having made conquests in Gaul, Caesar resolved to make war on these invaders. They refused to leave the country at his command, but tried to gain time by insincere negotiations. He outwitted them, surprised their camp, and defeated them with great loss, and thereafter built a bridge over the Rhine, by which he crossed into Germany, where he spent eighteen days, no one daring to offer any resistance to his movements.
First Invasion of Britain, ch. 20-38. Though the summer was nearly over, Caesar decided to make a short expedition into Britain, from which the Gauls were in the habit of getting assistance in war. There was some delay in collecting a fleet, but at last the Channel was successfully crossed and a landing made in spite of some resistance. The Britons were at first submissive, but after the Roman fleet had suffered severely in a storm, they prepared for hostilities. After defeating them in battle, the Romans returned safely to Gaul.

tence of Bk. Ill and note.
facta, missas : sc. esse.

I. trans: to the west bank ; the main body was between the Meuse (Maas) and the Rhine.
CHAPTER 10
Vosego: in fact the Meuse (Maas) flows not from the Vosges Mountains, but from the plateau of Langres. It is the Moselle which rises in the Vosges.

13. sunt qui . . . existimantur: some are thought.

CHAPTER 11
x6. milibus : ablative of degree of difference with abesset; amplius does not affect the case of nouns with numerals as an ordinary comparative. Caesar had advanced nearer to the Germans while the envoys were absent ; see page 85, lines 25, 26.
ut erat constitutum: referring to the return of the envoys ; see page 85, lines 23, 24.

accessisset: in direct discourse this would be subjunctive, but perfect tense, sustinete quoad accesserim ; W. 533 ; B. 293. III. 2 ; A. 328 ; H. 603. II.
Original from HARVARD UNIVERSITYcum : while, although.

n. trans Mosam: see chapter 9.
13. indutiis : for a truce, dative of purpose.	his : the latter, i. e.
nostris.
16. subfossis . . . deiectis : after stabbing the horses and unhorsing a good many of our men.
agminis : the main body of the army, who were following.
ex equitibus: when is the ablative with ex preferred to the partitive genitive? The German cavalry was better than the Gallic, and was used later by Caesar, as appears repeatedly in Book VII.
Piso Aquitanus: no doubt an Aquitanian who had obtained Roman citizenship, and assumed, as usual, a Roman name ; see note on Procillum, page 36, line 2.
genere: ablative of source.	regnum: see note on regnum,
page 3, line 10.

order not to miss any opportunity of battle.
13. diei: W. 348 ; B. 201. 3. a ; A. 223. e; H. 446. 5.	perfidia:
by accusing the Germans, Caesar diverts attention from his own rather sharp practice at this point. It is hard to explain why so many of the Germans put themselves into his power if their designs were treacherous.
simul . . . simul: not only . . . but also, or partly . . . partly.
purgandi sui: W. 642 ; B. 339. 5 ; A. 298. a ; H. 626. 3	con
tra atque : contrary to what; B. 341. 1. c); A. 247. d; H. 508. 5 ; 516. 3.
Original from HARVARD UNIVERSITY19. Quos, illos: both refer to the Germans.	sibi . . . oblatos
{esse): that they had put themselves into his power. The infinitive clause expresses the reason of the feeling of joy in gavisus; B. 331. V ; A. 333. b ; H. 614. 4.	gavisus : from gaudeo.

Page 89
X. Quorum timor cum : translate as if it were Cum eorum timor.
6. reliqua multitudo, etc. : the rest of the host consisting of children and women. The presence of these shows that this was not a mere inroad, but a migration.
8. ad quos consectandos : to hunt them down ; quos agrees with the individuals composing the multitudo, the masculine being preferred to the feminine when both are involved. Caesar was quite without scruples in his resolution to exterminate these German invaders and to give an awful example to their countrymen, in order to secure the Gallic frontier against future invasions.
CHAPTER 15
Germani: those who were fighting in advance.	clamore : of
those who were being killed in the camp.
signis : effigies of animals and the like, carried on poles.
confluentem : i. e. the junction of the Meuse (Maas) with the Waal, which is a branch of the Rhine ; see note on parte, page 86, line 4. But there are strong reasons for believing that Caesar is referring not to this locality, but to the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle. We should have to suppose that by the mistake of a copyist Mosae was written for Mosellae. But there are difficulties in the story, whichever way we understand this matter.
reliqua: further.
x6. ad unum : to a man.
17. cum : although.
Digitized by GoogleBOOK IV. CHAPTER 16
18. capitum: souls; cf. page 20, line 11, and note.	ccccxxx
milium: 430,000 seems an incredible number ; the same proportion as among the Helvetians in Book I would give 130,000 fighting men. No words are so often copied erroneously as numbers.
20. discedendi potestatem : if they had been as treacherous as Caesar alleged, we wonder why he treated them so leniently.
22. libertatem : permission to remain. When the Roman Senate voted a thanksgiving for this victory, Cato, Caesar’s enemy, proposed to surrender Caesar to the Germans on account of his breach of faith with them.
CHAPTER 16
ilia: the following.
iustissima: the strongest.
2*J. suis quoque rebus: on their own account also ; emphasis on suis.
29. Accessit. . . quod : and besides.

Ad quos : i. e. Sugambros.
intulissent: subjunctive by attraction, depending on dederent.

after a verb of hindering or preventing; W. 514 ; B. 295. 3; A. 331. e. 2 ; H. 568. 8 ; 595. 2.
transportaret: coordinate with ferret', line 14, depending on orabant; the direct quotation would be fer . . . transporta.
futurum (esse): sc. saying, from orabant\ line 14.
eius: i. e. Caesaris.	Ariovisto pulso : since the defeat of
Ariovistus; described in Bk. I, ch. 47-53.
22. possent: sc. Ubii.

CHAPTER 17
Rhenum transire : it can not be determined with complete certainty where Caesar’s bridge was built; most probably it was somewhere between Coblenz (Confluentes) and Andemach. There is, moreover, a strong reason for thinking that the rout of the Usipetes and Tencteri was near the junction of the Rhine and Moselle. There are also arguments in favor of Bonn as the site of the bridge. Mr. T. Rice Holmes, in his Coe- sar’s Conquest of Gaul, comes to the conclusion that this bridge, as well as the second one described in Bk. VI, ch. 9, was “built between Ander- nach and Coblenz.” This opinion has received strong confirmation by the discoveries and excavations of Nissen and Koenen, below Urmitz, a village midway between Andemach and Coblenz, an account of which was published in Caesars Rheinfestung (Sonderabdruck aus Bonner Jahr- biicher, Heft 104).
neque satis tutum: because his communications and line of retreat might be cut off.
dignitatis : predicate genitive.
proponebatur: presented, itself.	latitudinem: about 1,400
feet. The depth varies much.

a foot and a half thicky doubtless unhewn, driven into the bed of the river.
dimensa : of length proportioned.

cum : whenever, when in each instance ; W. 532. 2 ; B. 288. 3 ; A. 280. (2); H. 601. 4.
sublicae modo : like a piley i. e. perpendicularly.
secundum naturam : in the direction of the current.	eis . . .
contraria : opposite these.
duo : sc. tigna sesquipedalia. Each of these pairs was forty feet (measured on the bottom of the river, or on the surface of the water) below the corresponding pair of the former timbers. These latter pairs slanted up-stream.
quadragenum: genitive plural; B. 25. 6; A. 40. e; H. 169. The distributive numeral is properly used, because the distance was forty
feet in each instance.	ab inferiore parte : at the bottom.	contra
. . . conversa : slanting against.
Original from HARVARD UNIVERSITYBOOK IV. CHAPTER 18
Haec utraque . . . distinebantur: these two pairs were held apart.
bipedalibus trabibus: each trabs bipedalis just fitted into the two-foot space between the two timbers of each pair of tigna sesquipedalia.
	quantum . . . distabat: as much as the space between the timbers of
each pair.
binis . . . parte: by a pair of cross-ties at the upper end {of each pier). A fibula is ordinarily a clasp on the principle of a “ safety-pin.” These may have been wooden clamps with an iron bolt run through them, or, more probably, they may have been bound in their places with cords.
quibus disclusis . . . revinctis : when these (the pairs of timbers) had been held apart and braced in opposite directions, i. e. slanting up and down the stream.
15. rerum : the structure, considered as consisting of many parts.	
quo maior . . . hoc artius : the greater ... the more closely.
Haec derecta materia, etc. : These {bipedales trabes) were connected by timber laid on them, running lengthwise of the bridge {derecta) and covered over with planks {longuriis) and wickerwork {cratibus).
sublicae . . . agebantur: piles were driven down slantwise {oblique) below the piers {ad inferiorem partem fluminis) to act as buttresses {pro ariete).
aliae item : other piles were driven a short distance above the bridge, perhaps in groups of three, to protect the piers against the blows of any heavy bodies floated down by the enemy in order to break them. The arrangement of these piles can be only guessed at.
spatio : degree of difference with supra.
neu : = neve ; and that. . . not; B. 282. 1. d; H. 568. 6.
CHAPTER 18
Diebus x, quibus : within ten days from the time when. A very rapid piece of work. There are now very few bridges over the Rhine. Caesar’s engineers were excellent, but his own inspiring presence always made work go on faster than it did in his absence.	coepta erat: pas
sive because comportari is so ; B. 133. 1; A. 143. a ; H. 299. 1.
praesidio : a garrison, in a fort {castellum) at each end of the

pollicitus : sc. se daturum, conclusion of si . . . premerentur; direct discourse: dabo, «'. . . prememini ; W. 615 ; B. 319 ; A. 337 ; H. 646.
12. uti . . . demigrarent: depends on hortantes or some similar word implied in the expression nuntios . . . dimisisse. The subject of demigrarent is the Suebi in general.
15. Hunc : sc. locum.	medium fere : predicative ; as being about
in the center.
decertare : to decide the issue, by a battle.
omnibus eis rebus confectis : as he had accomplished all the objects ; rebus is explained by its appositives, the three following «/-clauses.
21. obsidione : the Ubii had been constantly beset by the Suebi, overpowered by them, and made to pay tribute ; see page 83, lines 4-8.
profectum (esse): from proficio not proficiscor ; satis is its subject. 	arbitratus : thinking; see note on page 43, line 29. Caesar accomplished by this expedition very little in the way of material results. It is likely, however, that he intended little more than to produce a moral effect by a “ demonstration in force ” on the German side of the Rhine.
CHAPTER 20
Exigua . . . reliqua: ablative absolute.
quod . . . vergit: since all Gaul lies far norths i. e. as compared with Italy.
omnibus . . . bellis: ablative of time when.
subministrata auxilia : this may have been a pretext rather than
a reason ; the help furnished can not have been of very material importance ; see page 68, lines 3, 4 ; page 49, lines 19-21. Caesar was the first Roman, so far as we know, to visit Britain, and the earliest ancient author to write from a personal knowledge of the country.	si: = etsi.
Page 93
adisset: for the future perfect of direct discourse; magno mihi usui erit«... adiero, etc. ; modo is here an adverb, only.
quae omnia: and all these things. But the Veneti must have known about them.

of, Celtica and Belgica.	vocatis . . . mercatoribus : though he called
the traders.
Original from HARVARD UNIVERSITYBOOK IV. CHAPTER 22

vented from, etc.
eundem portum : Portus Itius, probably ; see page 105, line 16. This may have been Boulogne or, more probably, Wissant. It must have been somewhere between Boulogne and Calais. The coast is much altered
since Caesar’s time.	equitibus: their number is not stated. It is
likely that 200 or 300 horsemen were ordinarily attached to a legion, and two legions were taken on this expedition. See Introduction, page xxxviii.

M.; the phrase ordinarily means either the period from the beginning to the end of the hour; or, if a point of time, the close of the hour, not its beginning; see Introduction, page Hi, foot-note. The distance from Boulogne to Dover is about thirty miles. Caesar lay at anchor off Dover till about 3.30 p. M.
Britanniam attigit: near Dover.
