Page 1. line I. [chap. 1. note I.] Gallia omnis. According to Zeuss, the word * gal * means a battle; hence might come ‘ gala, a warrior; plural, •galat.* Of Fa\6rrji the form KeKrrjt appears to be a contraction, much as Genf is of Geneva in German, and bptpi\ of kvoirij in Greek1. It is to be remarked that Gallia was a name given to the whole country only by foreign settlers, probably the Massaliots. So the names of Greece and Germany were in early times unknown to the inhabitants of these countries.
1.1, [2.] divisa in partes tree. These three parts are, according to Caesar, the Belgians from the Seine and Marne to the Rhine, the Aquitanians from the Pyrenees to the Garonne, and the Gauls proper occupying the rest of the country with the exception of the Roman province; the indigenes of which were mainly Ligurians and of the same stock with the Aquitanians.

1. 3* [4*] G-aUi. These Gauls, Galatians, or Celts, would appear from their position to have been the oldest settlers in the country except the Aquitani; but to have been pressed toward the west and south by later immigrations of Ligurians, Belgae, and Germans.
L 3. [5.] lingua, institutis. The Aquitanian language was the extraordinary Basque or Iberian, which still remains on both sides of the Pyrenees (3.11, note 2). The Belgians, as we learn from Tacit. Germ. 28, were anxious to be considered Germans and not Gauls; and so may have affected the German language, in spite of their warlike relations with the nations beyond the Rhine. But their genuine language must unquestionably have been Gallic; as this is sufficientlyNOTES. BOOK /, CHAP. I, 2.
proved by the Gallic character of the names of places in the Belgic territory both in Gaul and in Britain. See 2. 1, note a.
1. 8. [6.] mercatores minime saepe commeant. The main line of trade in Gaul followed the course of the Saone and Loire, with Gena- bum for an entrepot. The Belgians lay out of this line.
1. 8. [7.] atque... important, ‘or bring in articles tending to weaken men's courage and spirit.’
1. 13. [8.] cum aut. . . prohibent, * either in keeping them off from their own territories' (a temporal sentence for the gerund).
1. 15. [9.] eorum una pars, ‘one part, that is, of t^ie inhabitants of Gaul as above enumerated.'
F. 2.1. 2. [10.] ab Sequanis, &c., * on the side of the Seqtiani and Helvetii.' The meaning is, that the Belgian immigration had not gone down as low as Franche Comt6: hence this part of the country was still occupied by Gauls as far as the Rhine.
1. 3. [11.] vergit ad septentriones, ‘its slope is northerly.’ That is, the rivers of the true Galli, the Loire, Allier, &c., run in a northerly direction from the boundary of the province.
1. 5. [12.] septentrionem et orientem solem; so the Sambre, Scheldt, &c., the Belgian rivers, run to the north-east, and those of Aquitania, the Garonne and Adour, to the north-west.
1. 11. [o. 2. n. 1.] Orgetorix, ‘king of a hundred mountains,' according to Thierry’s somewhat off-hand derivation of the name. The more accurate Zeuss would lead us to the conclusion that the name is connected with • org,* to slay, and therefore it is, as he remarks, partly equivalent to * Caesar.' Orgetorix was chieftain of a powerful tribe, and had so many sources of influence, that he would naturally have been king of the country. But a series of revolutions, like those of an earlier period in Greece, had supplanted monarchism by popular governments. Hence his discontent, and his wish to induce Casticus and Dumnorix to aim at monarchy. Hence also the intense hatred with which such restorations were always regarded when made by Caesar. See 5. 54, note 4, and Introd. p. ix.

"took a south-western direction to the Rhone at Vienfie, constituting the southern boundary of Helvetia here described. The Rhine bounded that country on the north and east; the Jura on the west.
1. 23. [6.] homines bellandi cupidi. The word ‘homines* is in apposition to ‘ Helvetii * understood; and is therefore adjectival and equivalent to ‘ cum essent homines.’ It is consequently best omitted in English; translate * from their being so fond of war.’ 4 Qua ex parte * means * and from considering this fact ;* and there is no need to alter, as some editors do, to * qua de causa.*
1.24. [7.] pro multitudine, ‘ considering the extent of their population;'
1. 25. [8.] angustos is a predicate; ‘ considering that the territories .which they occupied were too narrow.* The positive for the comparative, as in Xen. Mem. 3. 13, 3, if/vxpfc, Start XovcaoOcu, kariv.

P. 3.1. 1 [3.] lege;4 by a popular resolution.'
1. 13. [4.] quin . . plurimum .. possent,4 that the Helvetii were the most powerful nation of Gaul.’ 4 Possum' means here absolutely 4 to be powerful:' not prolatively,4 to be able to do a thing.* So 4 valeo * is used in 2. 17. See also ch. 36, note 8.
1. 16. [5.] regno occupato, conditionally; 4if they could seize the royal power.*
1. 17. [6.] sese potiri posse sperant; as 4possum' has no supine, its infinitive present is used, as here, for the future. Its conditionals are generally, but not always, expressed absolutely, as 4 possum persequi multa oblectamenta reram rusticarum, sed ea, quae dixi, sentio fuisse longiora,* Cic. de Sen. 55. See Madv. Lat. Gr. 410, Obs. 1, 348. e.
1. 18. [o. 4. n. 1.] ea res,4 this conspiracy.' The generic word 4 res' is constantly used in Caesar, where in English we should use the specific words,4 occurrence,*4 movement,*4 exploit,' 4 misfortune,' 4 undertaking,* 4 intelligence,* ‘fact,* ‘heads of a summary,' 4mode of life,' ‘supplies,' &c., according to the context.
1. 19. [2.] moribus suis, ‘according to their custom:* ablativus normae: as in the phrases 4 more majorum,' 4 ea lege,'4 mea sententia.'
1. 20. [3.] damnatum poenam sequi oportebat. Punishment in a criminal cause, like property in a civil cause, was said by the Romans to 4 follow ’ the person to whom it was adjudged by law. Cp, Livy 33. 13,

1. 11. [5.] die constituta oausae dictionis; the genitive on genitive is more frequently used by Caesar than by any other writer. Thus we have (3.18) ‘superiorum dierum Sabini cunctatio/ The genitives ‘ dictionis’ and * dierum ’ seem to mean ‘ belonging to/ like * fiducia virium/
* aditus laudis/ * contentio honoram/ and the like.
1. 22. [6.] familia, * all his dependants:* the word, as being connected with ‘famulus/ properly means ‘a body of slaves;’ and is opposed to the ‘ liberi,* who constitute the family, as now understood. For the ‘obaerati/ see 6. 13.
L 28. [7.] suspicio; the length of the 1 probably comes by contraction for * suspidtio ;* cp. ‘ oonvrcia and pervicax/
1. 29. [8.] quin ipse sibi mortem consciverit; the negative ‘ quin * is carried on to the dependent sentence from the negative character of the main sentence ‘ neque abest suspicio/ Cp. the French construction ‘ je ne doutais pas que vous n’eussiez raison/
1. 29. [9.] consciverit; the meaning of * conscisco * is ‘ to decree or settle with oneself’ (censuit, consensit, conscivit, is a formula in Liv. 1. 3), hence this phrase for ‘ to commit suicide/
1. 29. [10.] ipse sibi, not * sibi ipsi/ ‘Ipse’ is more elegantly used as a subject than as an object.
1. 31. [o. 5. n. 1.] ut e finibus anis exeant; an objective sentence in apposition with ‘ id quod constituerant/ namely, to leave their own territory.
P. 4.1.2. [2.] ut. . . paratiores essent; ‘ut* is used instead of ‘ quo * here, because so many words intervene between it and the comparative.
1. 4. [3.] mensum, an older form of mensium. A comparison of the words menstruus, /rijv, /i«f», makes it probable that the i was no part of the original word. (Cp. Ovid Met. 8, 500, Fast. 5. 187, 424, Liv. 8. 2, 10. 5, Kiuner.)
1. 5. [4.] Rauraci, near Basle. Tulingi, near Schaffhausen. Latovicos, on the upper Danube in the Black Forest.
1. 7« [5-1 una cum iis; if ‘ secum ’ had been used there would have been a confusion with the * suis ’ immediately preceding. The words ‘Rauraci/ ‘Tulingi/ ‘Latovices/ are the subjects for the time most prominent, and therefore take the reflexive pronouns.
1. 8. [6.] Noreiam oppugnarant. The Boii had originally been expelled from Italy by the victories of Scipio Africanus, b.c. 161. Seizing the opportunity of these times of disturbance, they had established themselves at Noreia, in Styria, on the German side of the Brenner Pass;.NOTES. BOOK 7, CRAP. 6-8/	21$
and now detached one tribe of their nation to help the Helvetii. For their original immigration into Italy, see c. 28, note 6.
1. 10. [0. 6. n. 1.] itinera duo quibus itineribus. This fulness of expression is frequent in Latin where distinctness is required. It may bey abridged by omitting either the former or the latter of the two antecedents.
L ii. [2.] unum .. alterum. The first of these directions was along the right bank of the Rhone to the Pas de l’Ecluse and Culoz, the line of the present railway to Macon and Paris. To take the other direction, the Helvetii must have overwhelmed the legion which guarded the Rhone at Geneva, forced the passage of the river there, and so gained the road to Vienne and Lyons by way of Annecy and Chambery. (See Bertrand Voies Rom. en Gaule, p. 58.)
1. 12. [3.] vix qua singuli carri, hyperbaton; for ‘qua vix singuli carri/ like Ovid’s ‘ultor ad ipse suos coelo descendit honores;* and Horaee Sat. 2. 3, 110, • metuensque velut contingere sacrum.*
L 15. [4.] facilius multo; for their immediate purpose, that is, of leaving Switzerland, not for their ultimate object; as every mile further south, into what is now Savoy, would make them enter France at a point more disadvantageous for turning the great barrier of the Cevennes on their way to Santogne.
1. 24. [5.] ante diem V. Kal. April. • Cette date correspond * (says M. Leverrier in Jules C&ar, vol. 2. app. A) * au 24 Mars Julien, jour oh tombait l’&juinoxe du printemps. Les Helv^tes avaient pris cette £poque naturelle; C£sar l*a rapport^e au calendrier Romain.* The learned astronomer proves‘this by computing the days of the old style backwards from March ac. 4*5, when it was superseded by the Julian era, to the 5th of the Kalends of April, b.c. 38. (On the means adopted by barbarous nations for ascertaining the equinox, see Prescott, Peru, 1. p. 119.)
1. 26. [o. 7. n. 1.] Caesari cum id nuntiatum . . imperat, an unusual omission of the nominative with the principal verb.
1. 29. [2.] Genava appears from inscriptions to be the right orthography. The word, according to Gluck (Keltische Namen, p. 106), is from 4 gena/ the Celtic word for * mouth ;* and well expresses the position of Geneva, where the green waters of the lake crowd and hurry into the narrowing river course.
P. 5.1. 5. [3.] Ii. Cassium. This had occurred in the early part of the fearful invasion of the Cimbri and Teutones, b;c. 106, and Cassius* army was one of six swept away by these barbarians.
1. 13. [c. 8. n. i.] ea legione; the simple instrumental ablative, as Kraner remarks, because a legion is a kind of warlike implement.
1. 17. [2.] murum fossamque. According to the elaborate researches of an imperial author, these lines consisted of a series of redoubts defending the left or southern bank of the river, and connected together by a palisaded entrenchment cut in the bank itself. The Sequani wereNOTES. ZOOK 7, CHAP. 9-IX.
to guard, as they easily could, the narrow Pas de l’Ecluse; and the Helvetii were to be hindered from taking the Savoyard roads by the breaking of the bridge at Geneva and by the strength of the works defending the fords. See the map at p. 5 of the text 1. ai. [3.] et legati, better than * et ii/
1. 33. [4.] si vim facere conarentur, a remote supposition, * if they were to attempt the passage by force/ * Navibus junctis’ seems to mean 4 by making bridges of boats/
L 37. [5.] operis munitione, 4 by the strength of the works/ See chap. 38, note 4.
1. 38. [o. 0. n. 1.] una per Sequanos via. Being unable to force their way at once into the province, they resolved to try the north bank of the Rhone, by the former of the two ways described above.
1. 30. [3.] sua sponte. If this word is, as Donaldson supposes, a collateral form of * pondus/ we can see how the idea of * by their own weight’ would branch into the two meanings of 4 by their own influence* (as here) and ‘ of their own accord,* as usual.
1. 31. [3 ] ut eo deprecatore impetrarent,4 that by his intercession they might obtain what they wanted.’
P. 0. 1. 3. [4.] novis rebus studebat, 4 was anxious for revolution/ So 4 tabulae novae * is the common phrase for 4 the abolition of debts.*
1. 9. [o. 10. n. I.] non longe a Tolosatium finibus; about forty, miles. Kraner supposes the distance to have been greater, and Caesar to have understated it on purpose, so as to exaggerate the danger. See, however, the statement in 4 Jules C6sar’ ad loc.
1. 11. [3.] magno cum periculo provinciae futurum, ut... haberet. The periphrasis with 4 futurum esse* or4 fore,’ and the subjunctive, instead of the future infinitive 4 sese habiturum/ often indicates that the result expected will spring from various causes unspecified. The meaning is therefore 4 that things would so turn out, that he would find great danger in having,' &c.
1. l7- [3*] proximum iter ... per Alpes. That is, by Turin, Susa, and Mont Genevre to Brianfon and Embrun. The more direct road by Mont Cenis (the Cottian Alps) began to be used only in Augustus* time (Merivale Hist. Rom. vol. 1, p. 396).
1. 30. [o. 11. n. 1.] ita se de populo Romano meritos. Kraner quotes Tacit. Ann. 11. 35, 4 soli Gallorum (Aedui) fraternitatis nomen cum populo Romano usurpant/ Lucan Phars. 1. 427 speaks of the Arverni as	4	ausi Latio se fingere fratres
Sanguine ab Iliaco populi/
He perhaps confounds the Arvemi with the Aedui; and the legend was probably invented as a Roman explanation of the Gallic idea of brotherhood, which signified close political and military federation, not common descent.NOTES. BOOK /, CHAP. 12.
1. 33. [2.] Aedui Ambarri, that is, the Aedui round the Arar or Saone,’ as ‘ ambh ’ is the Greek dfMpl. The main body of the nation were on the east of the middle Loire. Their dominions contained Bibracte (Autun), the great druidical capital, and Noviodunum (Nevers), one of the great commercial cities of Gaul.
P. 7. 1. 1. [3.] necessarii, ‘close connections/ dvayrccuoi. Hence ‘ necessitudo * for ‘ friendship.* It was remarked at Rome, as a peculiarity in Caesar's style, that he used the word * necessitas * in the sense of ‘ necessitudo' (Meyer. Orat. Rom. Fragm. p. 412).
1. 2. [4.] sese depopulatis agris, &c., ‘that their lands had been ravaged, and that now they could hardly keep the enemy from their walls/
1. 5. [5.] nihil esse reliqui 5 a partitive genitive, like Livy 34. 49, * nec quidquam iis pensi est, quid faciant/
1. 9. [c. 12. n. 1.] flumen est Arar, &c., * the Saone is a river which flows/ See.	%
1. 10. [2.] incredibili lenitate; as compared with the Rhone, Adige, Po, or Tiber, the Saone would seem very slow in its course. At the time when these events took place, Caesar knew no streams ‘ waving their lazy lilies ;* and his allowing the expression to stand after the time of his British expedition favours the view that he wrote each book of the Commentaries at the close of the year in which its events occurred, and afterwards made no change in it.
1. 15. [3.] de tertia vigilia, * in the course of the third watch.* The passage was at Villefranche, or thereabouts. See 16, note 2.
1. 27. [4.] eius soceri. L. Calp. Piso, father of that Calpurnia who is familiar to us from Shakspeare. For the word ‘ pagus,’ see 4. 1, note 5, and for ‘ eius/ 2. 15, note 4. The Tigurini have become the prominent subject; whence the determinative, and not the reflexive, is used to refer to Caesar.
1. 27. [5.] iniurias: Pliny, Suetonius, and later writers use this word in the simple sense of * damage.* That Caesar here uses it in its proper sense, of damage done contrary to law, will be evident from a comparison of chap. 14. See the notes on that chapter. The assumption here is that all offensive warfare against Romans is necessarily wrong; combined with a second that it becomes a Roman family to maintain, generation after generation, the same attitude towards particular foreign nations. This would sometimes be kindly and protective (Diet. Antiq. Art. hospitium ad fin.), sometimes hostile, as in the case of the Flaminini towards Greece.NOTES. BOOK 1, CHAP. 13, 14.
1. 31. [o. 13. n. 1.] pontem faciendum curat. Lit. ‘he takes care of a bridge, as in the way of making.* Hence the double meaning, active and passive, of the future in * dus,’ as shewn in * secundus ’ on the one hand and • amandus ’ on the other. So in Greek we have fs*ver6a, Ciroirros, and a few other verbals in an active as well as a passive sense.
P. 8.1. 1. [2.] ut flumen transirent, in apposition with ‘ id.*
*	1. 6. [3.] ubi eos Caesar constituisset. Divico’s words, stated
directly, would have been 4 ubi nos constitueris,’ in the future perfect.
1. ii. [4.] aut ipsos despiceret. This pronoun refers distinctly to the Helvetii, the ‘suae* to Caesar, the subject. Cp. c. 40, • cur de sua virtute aut de ipsius diligentia desperarent?’
1. 13. [5.] magis virtute (contenderent), &c., 4 that they had been so instructed, as rather (to do their work) by valour, than make their way by artifice, or rely on ambuscades.* (Zeugma.)
1. 14. [6.] ne committeret, &c., ‘ let him not so act, that the place on which they stobd should bear a name or hand down a tradition from an overthrow of the Roman people, and the destruction of their army.’
1. 19. [o. 14. n. 1.] quo minus merito populi Bomani accidissent, 4 because they had been so little deserved by the Roman people.’
1. 20. [2.] qui si alicuius iniuriae conscius fuisset; an ordinary and characteristic expression of Roman diplomacy, which always made a point of professing its own purity, (much as Achilles in the Iliad assures his friends that it is a grave mistake to imagine that he loves* war). Thus in the Tiburtine inscription (engraved during the Samnite wars), the Senate accepts in the following terms a disclaimer of that people; 4 Ea nos animum nostrum non inducebamus ita facta esse, quod seibamus ea vos merito nostro facere non potuisse.* In the case of the Helvetii the missing 4 injuria’ might have been found, if the history of Roman kidnapping parties in the Alps could have been written.
1. 21. [3.] non fuisse difficile cavere, the oblique form of the direct 4 non erat difficile cavere,*4 it would not have been difficult.* So Cic. de Inv. 2. 135,4 non fuisse grave nec difficile,* and below, in 5. 29, we have 4 venturos esse,* as the oblique of ‘ venturi erant* In phrases expressing necessity, possibility, difficulty, care, right, wrong, and desirableness, the conditionals are mostly expressed in this absolute way. Thus we say 4 par erat,’ for 4 it would have been right,* ‘ quanto melius fuerat,* how 4 much better would it have been.* See chap. 3, note 5, for the application of this principle to the word 4 possumand Jelf s Greek Grammar, 858. 3, for the omission of &v in the corresponding Greek phrases.
1. 24. [4.] num memoriam deponere posse P the oblique form of 4can I lay aside?* See the last notes of 5. 28 and 5. 29. The infinitive form in oblique interrogatives marks that the question is in the first or third person, the conjunctive that it is m the second person.NOTES. BOOK I, CHAP. 15, 16.
Thus ‘quid tandem vererentur* is the oblique of ‘why do you fear?* ‘num Caesarem deponere posse,’ ‘could Caesar lay aside?* See Madvig Lat. Gr. p. 359, and the examples there given. The reason for this rule is that in the former, case ‘ quaerebat,’ in the latter ‘ censent ’ is understood.
I. 27. [5.] quod sua victoria gloriarentur, ‘ as for their boasting of their victory.* This sentence is the subject of the infinitive ‘eodem pertinere.*
1. 29. [6.] oonsuess© enim deos immortales. These sentences will repay attentive study. Their oratorical character is evident enough; as marked by the anaphora of * quod ’ with * Aeduos,’ ‘ Ambarros,’ • Allo- brogas; ’ by the sonorous period beginning with ‘ consuesse enim deos immortales,* and by the transition from the common to the dramatic oblique at ‘ cum ea ita sint* Kraner has well remarked that Divico had hot said anything in the way of direct boasting. This eloquent passage was perhaps an answer to his manner, or to the fact that he was the same Divico who had slain L. Cassius.
1. 33. [7.] dentur ... intelUgat... intulerint .. . satisfaciant; observe how this lighter and more dramatic form of the oblique construction retains the tenses actually used by the speaker, instead of depressing them into darentur . .. intelligent. .. intulissent... satisfacerent ; and thus brings out the difference between the general considerations which precede and the practical ones here entered upon.
P. 9. 1. 12. [o. 15. n. 1.] alieno loco, ‘on unfavourable ground* So ‘ favourable* may be expressed by * suus/ Cic. pro Quint. 29, ‘Alphenus utebatur populo sane suo,’4 Alphenus had the people quite on his side.’ And below, in 5. go, ‘ suus locus * means ‘ ground chosen by himself.*
1.15. [3.] subsistere; here ‘ to make a stand,’ not like Livy’s ‘ feras subsistere/ (1.4.) That is, ‘ gradum * is understood.
1. x5* [3*] nonnumquam et, 8cc., asyndeton; (and) • sometimes even to offer battle at their rear/ The * et * expressed is an adverb.
1. 3i. [4.] quinis aut senis; collectives. So ‘ bina castra/ generally, when both camps belong to the same army; ‘ trinae catenae,* when all three chains are on the same person.
1. 23. [0. 16. n. 1.] flagitare; ‘kept asking;’ lit. ‘began to ask frequently/
1. 25. [2.] ne pabuli quidem. This shows how remarkably the climate of the south of France must have changed since Caesar’s time. He had waited near Geneva till the 24th of March and a few day9 after. Then, crossing the Alps in person, he had levied two legions and mobilised three more at Aquileia. This, with the time necessary for the march from Aquileia to Lugdunum, must have occupied not less? than two months, and the date of his arrival at Lugdunum must have been about June 6. Meanwhile the Helvetii had followed the rightNOTES. BOOK I, CHAP. 17,
bank of the Rhone as far as Culoz, and then gone by Amberieux to the Saone at Villefranche. After this they had occupied twenty days in crossing the Saone; yet the crops of the year were not far advanced.
1. 39. [3.] conferri, comportari, * that it was collecting and conveying to Caesar/
1. 31. [4.] frumentum metiri, • to give the soldiers their monthly allowance of 50 lbs. of com/
P. 10.1.1. [5.] quem vergobretum appellant, * the holder of which office they call the Guerg-breath* (strong in judgment). We learn from 7. 33, that the • vergobret * could not leave the state during his term of office: and that no one could be elected, if a living member of his family had held the post. It seems probable that the adjective * guerg* is the origin of * quercus* (the strong tree).
1. 4. [6.] tarn neoessario tempore, * at a time of such urgency/
1. 6. [7.] multo etiam gravius, * with still greater vehemence/ The punctuation in the text, which is that of Kraner and Nipperdey, seems undoubtedly correct. The common way of expressing the same sense would be ‘ quo magis eorum predbus adductus bellum susceperit; eo etiam gravius .. . queritur/ The * et’ before praesertim is omitted, as in c. 23, * eo magis quod proelium non commisissent/
. L 10. [o. 17. n. 1.] qui privatim plus possint: an unhallowed alliance like that of Ap. Claudius Censor at Rome, between the high aristocrats and the common people against the republican government. See chap, a, note 1.
L 1 a. [a.] quod praestare debeant. The relative clearly should agree with * frumentum,* • the com which they had to supply/ It is then better in the next clause to read 1 praeferre/ and translate * if they could not occupy thrones themselves, they thought the dominion of Gauls better than that of the Romans/ * Praeferre* seems in this case to be the same as * priora habere/ It is, however, possible that * perferre malle' may be the true reading; there are obvious reasons why the second word might have dropped out.
[3.] neque dubitare (debeant). It seems plain that the last word should be omitted, being a copyist repetition from the end of the preceding clause,
[4.] quin .. . sint erepturi; the strong future subjunctive for ‘ which the present subjunctive ‘eripiant* might be substituted in a lighter style.
1. 18. [5.] neoessario .. . coactus; some MSS. and editions read * necessarium/ apparently with the intention of avoiding tautology. It appears, however, simpler to translate * when he could not help it, and on express compulsion/ Cp. Bell. Civ. 3. 49, ‘necessario loca sequi demissa cogebantur/ and Ter. Andr. 4.1. 8, * tum coacti necessario se aperiunt*JTOTES.	BOOK I, CHAP _	319
1. 26. [e. 18. n. i.] ipsum esse Dumnorigem, 'that Dumnorix was the particular or exact person meant.* Cp. Cic. Att. 3. 21, ‘triginta dies erant ipsi, cum has dabam literas.*
1. 27. [2.] summa audacia; the appellative 'virum* omitted, as in Liv. 22. 60, ‘ Turn Tit. Manlius Torquatus, priscae et nimis durae severitatis, ita locutus fertur.*
1. 30. [3.] lioeri. The root of this verb seems to be the same as that of the verb 4 linquo.’ (Curtius Griech Etym. vol. 2. p. 50.) Hence we have, first, the middle or deponent form 'liceor,* ‘to get a thing left to oneself,* and thence ‘ to bid for it,’ and secondly, the intransitive form * liceo,* meaning 4 to be left (that is, sold) at a given price.’ On the revenues farmed by Dumnorix, see Mr. Long’s interesting note.
1. 33. [4.] numerum equitatus: so 4 numerus pecudum,* or * impedimentorum,* the numbering of cavalry,, baggage-animals, or cattle, being a familiar idea; but' multitudo hominum, populorum, telorum,’ and the like.
P. 11.1. 6. [5.] favere et cupere Helvetiis. The full phrase would ►be ‘cupere omnia Helvetiorum causa,* or 4 cupere omnia quae Helvetii,’' like Hor. Sat. 1. 9, 5,' cupio omnia quae vis.’
1. 7. [6.] suo nomine, lit. ' on an entry of his own,* that is, • on his own account.’
1. 8. [7.] potentia eius. In chap. 5, note 4 we have seen ' cum iis * used for ' secum,’ in order to prevent confusion as to the subject referred to. Here the object of writing 4 eius ’ instead of • sua,* seems to have been to express distinctly that the power of Dumnorix had been really diminished:'' potentia sua ’ might have "meant only that he said it had been diminished.
1. 10. [8.] si quid accidat Bomanis: litotes, a gentle way of saying anything ill-omened; like ' animadvertere,’ ‘ to punish,* tX ti iraBoitv, 4 if they were slain; * «I S* avTix°lfV *x9p°'h * if the enemy got the better* (lit. held out).
1. 11. [9.] imperio populi Boxnani, ‘as long as the empire of the Romans lastedablative of circumstance, like 4 leni fuit Austro captus,’ Hor. Sat. 2. 8, 7; 'quid hoc populo obtineri potest?* Cic. de Leg. 3- 16.
1. 13. [10.] in quaerendo, ‘ in the course of his enquiries.*
1. 13. [11.] quod proelium equestre adversum is equivalent to ' quae fuga equitum,’ whence the following construction,4 initium eius fugae.'
1. 19. [0.19. n. i.] quod traduxisset, ‘namely that he had given a passage.* The subjunctive implies that the fact is well known and not new to the reader. Where this is not the case we have 4 quod cognoverat ’ a few lines down.
1. 22. [2.] quod accusaretur, 'an offence of which he was accused.*NOTES. BOOK I, CHAP. 20, 21.
1. 25. [3.] his omnibus rebus, to all these considerations:* see chap. 4, note 3.
1. 25. [4.] Divitiaci fratris. Divitiacus, though a Druid of high rank, was die most Romanized of all the Gauls. In b.c. 63 he had gone to Rome to obtain help for his country against Ariovistus (6. 12). The Senate being occupied at the time with Catiline’s conspiracy, deferred their answer; and Divitiacus remained at Rome, frequenting the best society, and enjoying the acquaintance of Cicero, who consulted him, as a Druid, on the subject of his treatise de Divinatione (de Div. 1. 41, and Thierry, book 5. chap. 3). The name is derived from the Celtic ‘diu,’ a god, whence 'deadhach,* ‘ religious’ (Gluck, p. 5).
1. 3a [5.] quotidianis interpretibus, &c.f' dismissing the ordinary interpreters.*
P. 12. 1. 3. [6.] sine eiua offensione animi: see 3. 18, note 4;
* offensione animi ’ is taken as if it were one word. The  ipse ’ which follows refers to Caesar.
1. 7. [c. 20. n. 1.] scire se, an elegant omission of * dixit.*
L 10. [2.] per se crevisset; understand * opibus et nervis.*
1. 14. [3.] si quid acoidisset: see chap. 13, note 3.
1. 16. [4.] futurum uti averterentur; chap. 10, note s.
1. 19. [5.] rogat finem orandi faciat. As in chap. 14, it is well to remark the graceful way in which the historic presents at the end of this chapter relieve and lighten the strict oblique constructions at the beginning ; and how the short successive sentences brmg the narrative to an agreeable close, with the air of a complete summary.
1. 21. [6.] eius voluntati condonet* See., * that in consideration of his good-will he would not punish the wrong done to the republic or his own personal annoyances.'
1. a8. [c. 21. n. 1.] hostes sub monte consedisse. After crossing the Saone near Villefranche, the Helvetii had passed by S. Vallier; and were now encamping at the foot of Mont Tauffrin, near Issy l’Evdque. The road up to this point had been one on which no military manoeuvre was possible.
1. 30. [2.] qualis esset natura montis, See., ‘he sent scouts to ascertain the character of the hill, and the chance of ascending it on its various sides.' The Mont Tauffrin was apparently the first height sufficiently parallel with the road to conceal a flank movement slightly to the left of it, made for the purpose of heading the Helvetii and barring the road in advance of them.
1. 32. [3.] de tertia vigilia; the night-watches began at sunset and ended at sunrise. At this season the sun set nearly at 8 p.m., and therefore rose nearly at 4 a.m. The third watch therefore began at midnight, and the fourth at 2 a.m. See M. Leverrier's table of the military hours (Jules C&ar, vol. 2. app. B).SOTJSS. &OOK I; CHAP. 22, 23.	221
1. 32. [4.] legatam pro praetore, propraetor and lieutenant-general commanding a legion.
I. 33. [5.] iis ducibns, qai iter cognoverant,4 using as guides the same persons whom he had sent to reconnoitre the way.*
IP. 13.1.1. [6.] quid sni consilii, like ‘nihil reliqui,* in chap. 11,and * nec quidquam iis pensi est,* Liv. 34. 49. Observe Caesar’s effective method in narrating. He states here only that he gave Labienus his orders: what these orders were, the sequel brings out in a more telling way than a detailed account of the orders as given would do.
1. 10. [o. 22. n. x.] equo admisso, ‘ with his horse at 'full speed.*
}. 12. [2.] insignibus Gallicis, the devices on their shields and helmets. Observe that • Gallic * is equivalent to * Helvetian ’ here. The inference which Caesar drew from Considius’ information was, that Labienus had been repulsed, perhaps destroyed; and that he must expect an attack at once.
L 18. [3.] multo die, ‘when the day was muck* that is, * far advanced.’
1. 20. [4.] quod non vidisset, pro viso, an amount of bewilderment hard to imagine.. Was Caesar always generous in his account of the proceedings of his subordinates ? He certainly does not spare Cotta and Sabinus in 5. 29 foil.: yet a general now-a days would hardly blame so violently officers who had paid for their fault with their lives. But cp. Chesney’s Campaign in Virginia (vol. 2. p. 65), where Napoleon, 'Frederic the Great, and Wellington are compared as regards this point.
1. 22. [5.] milia passuum tria; just like the phrase * hasta sex pedes longa,* ‘ a lance (to) six feet in length; * so a distance may be expressed as extending to six miles, and therefore by the accusative case. On the form ‘ milia,* see 8. 4, note 2.
1. 24. [o. 23. n. 1.] postridie ejus diei; ‘posteri* is the ablative agreeing with ‘ die ’ (cp. postea, and antea). The pleonasm of ‘ diei ’ is like * perfacile factu esse probat conata perficere * in chap. 3.
1. 24. [2.] biduum is an abridgement of ‘bidivum.* When this is reduced to a dissyllable, the first syllable becomes long by position.
1. 28. [3.] iter avertit, asyndeton; * he therefore turned his march aside.*
1. 29. [4.] Bibracte. The main road pursued by the Helvetii would have left a little on the right this city, so celebrated as the druidical capital of Gaul. Its ancient name still remains in the Mont Beuvray, which appears, by recent excavations \ to have been its site. On the peculiarity of its position for a capital, se^ Jules C6sar, vol. 2. p. 67, 1NOTES. BOOK I, CHAP.	25.
fcnd Michelet, Hist, de France (vol. 2. p. 301) for the contrast between it and Lyons. ‘ Lyon,’ says M. Michelet, * assis sur la grande route des peuples, a toujours prospdrd et grandi; Autun, chaste et sevfere, est restd seul sur son torrentueux Arroux, dans l’6paisseur de ses forets, entre ses cristaux et ses laves/ The Roman name, Augustodunum, of the modern town near its site, has been corrupted into Autun.
1: 29. [5.] fugitivos L. Aemilii, ‘ deserters from L. Aemilius/ The whole allied cavalry was divided into ten turmae; to each of these were appointed three decuriones. Aemilius was the senior of the three in his turma.
P. 14.1. 1. [6.] intercludi posse confiderent. The Helvetii, that is, believed that they could bring the Romans to a stand, and so hinder their reaching Bibracte, where their supplies were.
1. 3. [c. 24. n. 1.] id animum advertit; tmesis, as in Lucret. 2. 124, * Hoc etiam magis haec animum te advertere par est/
1. 4. [2.] in proximum oollem; this was a hill nearly west of Bibracte; for Caesar had not turned to the right till the Helvetii were some distance past the turn in a north-west direction: see Jules Cdsar, plan 5.
1. 5* [3*] Qui sustineret hostium impetum, 1 to harass the enemy while forming/ and so leave time for his own dispositions: * sustineo * means * to check/
1. 6. [4.] in colle medio» 4 half way up the hill/
1. 7. [5.] in summo iugo, ‘ on the table land at the top/ After • veteranarum * the MSS. read * ita uti supra, sed in summo iugo/ &c. if the first words are not a gloss, they mean 4as he had done the day before/ But it is better to read as in the text.
1. 9. [6.] ac totum . . . montem complevit, * and so covered the whole of the hill with his forces/
1. 12. [7.] cum omnibus suis carris; it may therefore be doubtful whether they had with them 8,000 waggons, as the author of Jules Cdsar supposes.
1.13. [8.] confertissima acie. This ablative appears to be adverbial to the ‘ successerunt * which follows, * after repelling our cavalry and forming their phalanx, they ascended in very close order/ For the multiplication of participles, cp. * suppliciter locuti dentes pacem petierunt/ in chap. 27, and Xen. Anab. 5. 1, 2, emOv/jua iieraOels,, &<nrtp ’Odvoirevs, KadtvSojv &<pitcto$cu cIs tijv 'EAAd&i.
[o. 25. n. 1.] suo, deinde omnium remotis equis; that is, the horses of all his staff and c^ief officers. Plutarch records that Caesar ordered the groom who took the horse to bring him back for the pursuit as soon as the enemy were routed.
1. 20. [2.] magno ad pugnam erat impedimento, i. e. * loco impedi- menti/ • it was a great hindrance in the way of their fighting/NOTES. BOOK I, CHAP. 26, 2J,
1. 24. [3.] praeoptarent, &c.f 4 after pulling for a long time at the shields so pinned together, many of them chose to drop their shield and fight unprotected * (rather than endure such trouble any longer).
1. 26. [4.] circiter mille passuum, accusative governed by the * distabat * which is implied in suberat/
L 27. [5.] capto monte. This hill they occupied; the Montagne du Chateau de la Garde, a little east of Autun and north of the road on which the armies were marching.
1. 28. [6.] qui agmen hostium claudebant: the Tulingi, who had originally occupied the van of the march, and therefore were left in the rear when the Helvetii suddenly turned to follow Caesar.
1. 30. [7.] latere aperto aggressi circumvenire, * attempted to tum our right flank/ the side on which the men's shields were not.
1. 33. [8.] conversa signa bipartito intulerunt; as the Tulingi can hardly have got quite to the rear of Caesar’s reserves, this must mean that the third line formed up ‘ en potence/ at right angles, that is, to the main body. Lit. * changed their front so as to face two different ways.* F. 15.1. 2. [c. 26. n. 1.] anoipiti proelio, &c., ‘so the conflict long continued; maintained very fiercely in both directions/
1. 5. [2.] naxn hoc toto proelio, &c., 4 they fell back in order* (se contulerunt) ; • for (nam) in all this battle no one saw the back of an enemy/ 1. 9. [3.] et e loco superiore, &c., * and thus from a vantage-ground threw their javelins.* The mean cast of a javelin being about twenty- five yards, it would gain great strength even from so small an elevation as the height of the carts.
1.11. [4.] matara; called ‘materis’ in Livy. The word is Celtic (derived from medrydd, ‘ to aim at a mark ’).
[5.] in fines Lingonum; they fled (by Lormes and Avalon) to Tonnerre on the edge of the Plateau of Langres.
1. 20. [6.] qui si, i. e. ‘ nam si ii juvissent/ Eodem loco, that is 4 hostium loco/ Dr. Kennedy has well pointed out that the dative of the purpose cannot be used when the substantive implies a person. Accordingly the phrase ‘hostis loco habere’ supplies the place of 4 hosti habere/ which is not Latin.
1. 24. [c. 27. n. 1.] cum eum convenissent. ‘Convenio’ with the accusative means * to meet or call upon/ as in Cic. de Sen. io, 4 nemo adhuc convenire me voluit cui fuerim occupatus/
1. 24. [2.] qui ... eos . .. paruerunt; the first of these words relates to the ambassadors, the two last to the main body, by a rather loose construction.
1. 30. [3.] nocte intermissa, 4 a night having intervened/ for the collection of the men and weapons (ea) required.
1. 31. [4.] Verbigenus, from Soleure, Lucerne, Aargau, and part of Berne.J	TOTES.BOOK I, CHAP. 38-30.

1. 5. [c. 28. n. 1.] «i sibi purgati esse vellent, 4 if they wished to be clear before him.*
1. 5. [2.] hostium numero habuit, a sternly simple euphemism, death by the sword; they had broken a capitulation: cp. 2. 33.
1. 8. [3.] reverti iussit, ' as a shepherd drives back his wandering flock,’ so Floras delicately states it (Jules C^sar, vol. 2. p. 72).
1. ro. [4.] ut iis frumenti copiam facerent, < to give them supplies of com for the yeaT.’
1. 13* [5-] bonitatem agrorum; the lands, that is, of the great western plain of Switzerland, just east of the Jura; and lying along the present railway from Berne to Basle. The cultivation there is now like that of a garden.
[6.] Boios. A section of this nation had in A.U C. 364 crossed the Great St. Bernard in company with the Lingones, and occupied part of the Etruscan territory (Liv. 5. 35). We thus trace their connection with the Aeduan part of Gaul; and understand the motive of kindred which induced the Aeduans to retain them. Besides this, they would be useful to them as a rampart against the Arvemi, their ancient rivals. D’Anville, in fact, places the new settlement now made at Gorgobina in the angle between the Loire and the Allier; and this is confirmed by 7. 9. (ad fin.): see the general map of Gaul.
Aduatuci: see the map inserted at 4. 1.
1. 21. [c, 29. n. 1.] tabulae Graecis literis confectae; the neigh* bourhood of Marseilles had made the Greek alphabet familiar; and the Gallic words of the muster-roll in question were written in this character. No Gallic alphabet is known. A specimen of the mode of writing may be seen on the coins discovered at Alesia; where we have the names AEIVICIACOS, along with DUBNOREX and VERCINGETORIXS. Cp. 6.14.
1. 24. [2.] quarum omnium rerum,' under all these various heads,* the grand total was 368,000; of whom exactly a fourth part were capable of bearing arms. As 110,000 returned home, and the Boii, who had originally been 32,000, were spared, it would appear that about 226,000 Helvetii perished in this four months* campaign.
1. 28. [3.] summa fuerunt ad milia; the verb is in the plural by attraction to the complement4 milia/
F. 17.1. 1. [0. 30. n. 1.] intellegere sese, (dixerant) : as in c. 20 (init.).

1.10. [4.] idque Caesoris voluntate, that he might not suppose that this meeting meant conspiracy against him : see chap. 35, note 2.
1.13. [5.] ne quis enuntiaret is the object of the verb ‘sanxerunt/
1.15. [6.] concilio; this assembly was one in which all cities of Gaul, without exception, were represented. (Thierry, book 4, chap. 1, p. 312).
[o. 81. el i.] secreto in occulto, in a private place, and with all other precautions for secrecy.
L 19. [2.] oontendere et laborare, &c., * that they were as earnestly and as desperately anxious that their secret should be kept as they were that their request should be granted/

1. 22. [4.] in cruciatum se venturos; so Caesar uses 'venire in spem ’ or 1 periculum/
1. 23. [5.] Divitiacus: see chap. 19, note 4. He had been the leader of the Aedui in their battle with Ariovistus.
1. 26. [6.] factum esse uti; see chap. 10, note 2. So * futurum ut/ below in this chapter.
1. 3 7* [7*] arcesserentur; on the etymology of this verb see Donaldson’s Varronianus, p. 352, and Kritz on Sail. Cat. 40. 6. Donaldson considers it to be a compound of ' accedere sino/ another form being 4 accerso/
1. 29. [8.] homines feri et barbari, 'this fierce and barbarous people: ’ see chap. 2, ‘ homines bellandi cupidi/ with the note.
P. 18.1. 7. [9.] neque recusaturos quo minus. The use of' quo- minus * springs from the euphemistic courtesy of the Latin language. It is more polite to say, ' I will hinder you so that you shall the less do what you wish/ than to say, ‘ quin (ut non) facias/ ‘ so that you shall not do it/ So after ‘recuso’ the refusal is less point blank, as far as expression goes, with ‘quominus’ than it would be with ‘ quin/
1. 14. [10.] Ariovistus. Zeuss and Grimm both agree that the first syllable of this name is probably ‘ Aar/ an eagle, as in the name of the Arii, a tribe of the Suevi. In that case as First is a form of Horst (a nest), the name Ariovistus may be like the modem name ‘ Falken- horst; ’ the last r being naturally omitted by a Roman.
1. 15. [11.] tertiam partem agri, a common mulct in ancient times. Porsena cut off from Rome ten out of her thirty tribes. Liv. 2. 41, init, imagines that two-thirds of their lands were taken from the Latins and Heroici by Sp. Cassius.

la France. On y compte trente forSts/ As the main commerce of the Sequani consisted in the export of hams (Thierry, vol. i. p. 443) we may assume that that country was in the same state then. The manner of feeding swine in those times is cleverly described by Hume (Essay 10).
1. 21. [13.] neque conferendum esse, &c.,1 the soil of Gaul was too good to be compared with that of Germany.* On the other hand, Cicero generally uses the expression ‘conferre parva magnis, minima cum maximis/ &c., yet in Tuse. 1. i, ‘ quae natura, non literis, assecuti sunt Romani cum Graecia non sunt conferenda* (as being superior). For the use of‘comparo/ see Cic. de Orat. 2.173.
1. 23. [14.] hanc consuetudinem victus. Divitiacus said, ‘ haec consuetudo* in the sense of ‘ nostra* (as ‘ iste* means that of yours,4 ille* that of his). So Livy, 1. 56, expresses 4 our present magnificence* by 4 nova haec magnificentia/
1. 23. [15.] Ariovistum autem . . factum sit, elegant and natural change to the dramatic oblique: see chap. 14, note 7.
1. 25. [16.] quod proelium: see chap. 6, note I.
1. 25. [17.] Magetobrigae, 4 the great mountain/ (from 4 maith* the Celtic form of fiiyas and 4 brig/ or 4 bry/ 4 a fell'). As the letter g would be pronounced with a light guttural sound, we see that the name would naturally be soon spelt Magetobria, as in many editions. The locality is not known.
1. 27. [18.] exempla cruciatusque, 4 all kinds of punishments and torments;* cp. Tacit. Ann. 12. 20, ‘meritum novissima exempla Mithridatem/ that Mithridates had deserved capital punishment.
1. 30. [19.] nisi si quid auxilii sit, ‘unless, indeed, they could obtain some help/ a modest or remote supposition. So Cic. Cat. 2. 4, 4 nisi vero si quis est, qui Catilinae similes cum Catilina sentire non putet/

1. 28. [c. 33. n. 1.] secundum ea, &c., 4 besides these considerations many others induced him.* 4 Secundus * appears to be another form of 4 sequens/ and therefore means 4 following/ or 4 besides.* So we have ‘oriundus* in the sense of ‘oriens/ and a similar formation probably from the future in 4 moribundus/ 4 gemebundus/ &c.NOTES.

33* [3-] i*1- tanto imperio, 4 while the empire of the Roman people was so great;’ the prepositional ablative absolute used, as the verb ‘-sum * has no participle. So Sallust uses the two phrases 4 perditis rebus/ and 4 in extremis rebus/ with the same meaning. So also we have in Cic. Off. 2, 4uti in re non dubia testibus non necessariis,* witnesses being unnecessary when the case was so certain: and Liv. 31. 36, ‘ex tam propinquis stativis parum tuta frumentatio erat/ as the camps were so near one another, foraging was unsafe,

1. 9. [6.] quibus rebus, which danger should, he thought, be met as soon as possible.
1. 11. [7.] arrogantiam sumpserat. Caesar here sums up with admirable brevity the grounds which induced him to go to war with Ariovistus. To complete the view of the status, some other facts, however, must be taken into account. The Sequani had originally attacked the Aedui (and called in Ariovistus to their help), because of the tyranny exercised by them in laying excessive tolls on the dried meat trade of the Saone mentioned above. Shortly after this battle, in B.C. 61, the Roman senate, in order to guard against the expected Helvetian invasion, had sent messengers to the chief Gallic cities to induce them to oppose it; and in pursuance of this object had passed the decree for the protection of the Aedui and other allied states, to which Caesar refers in chap. 35, a step which, taken so late as it was, showed but little * fraternal’ affection (Cic. ad Att. 1. 18). At the same moment, and with the same object, they sent confidential messengers to Ariovistus, saluting him as 4 rex et populi Romani amicus/ recognising thus his claims on Gaul, and according to Plutarch, inviting him to Rome (Vita Caes. 19). In this manner they persuaded him not to favour the Helvetian invasion; but their duplicity in allying themselves with oppressed and oppressor at once led to its natural consequences in the war now to be narrated.

1. 16. [3.] si quid ipsi, a model sentence for reflexive and determinative pronouns. The reflexives (referring to Ariovistus) are * ipse * in the nominative and dative, 4 se * and 4 sese * in the accusative; the determinatives referring to Caesar are 4 ille/ 4 illum/ * eum/ The last4 illum * might be elegantly omitted, as it is in some editions.

1. 7. [6.] se Aeduorum; observe the repetition of 'se,’ its reason, and its effect on the rhythm of the sentence.
1. 9. [c. 36. n. 1.] ius esse belli ut qui vicissent, the perfect' respondit* depresses the perfect ‘vicerint* into a pluperfect. Similarly the present is often depressed into an imperfect subjunctive; as in c. 40,

1. 25. [9.] inter annos quatuordecim, so Kraner and Nipperdey; alii, 4 intra/ The meaning of4 inter* is well shown by Livy, 1. 10, ‘bina postea inter tot annos, tot bella, opima parta sunt spolia4 (all through so many years, &c.) ‘Intra* would mean ‘since fourteen years began,* or ‘ before fourteen years* end/
1. 27. [o. 37. n. 1.] haeo eodem tempore .. et. The two contem-* poraneous events expressed coordinately. We should subordinate the former, and say, * at the same time that this message was brought to Caesar, messengers also came from the Aedui/
1. 29. [2.] qui nuper . . transportati essent, * who, they said, had been recently brought over into Gaul,* quasi oblique.
1. 29- [3.] fines eorum; see chap. 5, note 4.
F. 22. 1. 3. [4.] minus facile resisti posset. Caesar’s real meaning is that the combined forces would then become irresistible. But to a Roman the use of such an expression would of itself be a bad omen. See Paley’s note to Aesch. Agam. 1631. Cp. the litotes in ‘ut satis commode supportari posset frumentum,* in chap. 39. Observe that ‘resisti’ is impersonal, the ‘illi’ which it governs being omitted.
1. 4. [5.] magnis itineribus. See Veget. 1. 9, ‘militari gradu xx. milia passuum horis quinque dumtaxat aestivis conficiuntur: pleno autem gradu, qui citatior est, xxiv. milia peragenda sunt/ The Roman mile is, however, only 1614 yards.

1. 23. [0. 39. n. 1.] vocibus, the random conversation of the Gauls and of the traders (those who came to supply the camp).
1. 24. [2.] incredibili virtute. The ablative is used to state details of character, and therefore where, as in this place, many qualities are enumerated. On the other hand, the genitive of quality expresses a leading quality or summary of character, as in 66. 8, ‘jumenta . . summi ut sint laboris efficiunt/ Cicero uses both cases in Ep. Quint. Frat. 2. ii, ‘Lucretii poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt: non multis luminibus in- • genii, multae tamen artis: * see Madvig’s Lat. Gr. p. 252.
25. [3.] saepenumero, like in ‘hic loci/ * tum temporis/ 4 ubi gentium/ 1 dulcissime rerum/ In all these cases the Latin language adds to the adverb the general idea of space, time, number, &c., under which it comes. So in English we have ‘oftentimes/ ‘manifold/ &c.
1. 30. [4.] amicitiae causa Caesarem secuti; the kind of persons to whom Frederick the Great objected so strongly (Macaulay’s Essays, p. 280). Probably Caesar was too deep in debt when he began campaigning to be stem in refusing such appointments to his creditors’ friends where, on military grounds, he ought to have done so. The ‘ scientia et usus militum ’ (43. 3) was to supply all such shortcomings. See Cic. ad Fam. 7. 8.
1. 32* [5-] alius alia oausa illata, ‘alleging severally all kinds of causes/ What would be the full construction ?
1. 32. [6.] necessariam, ‘indispensable/
1* 33* [7*] ut eius voluntate discedere liceret; as * liceo ’ means literally ‘ to be left ’ (chap. 18, note 3), we see that the expression ‘ that it might be left to them by his good-will * is not so really pleonastic as it seems to be (chap. 35, note 3).

1. 5. [11.] testamenta, not the ‘testamenta militaria/ ‘which were at one time privileged to be nuncupatory,’ but regular documents. Did they make the Germans their executors ? The mixture of vexation and comedy in Caesar’s narrative is amusing.

1. 16. [o. 40. n. 1.] omnium ordinum; to this council of officers Caesar summoned all the centurions, and not only those of the highest rank (besides the legates and tribunes). See Diet. Antiq. p. 505. a, for all that is known about these differences of military rank.
1. 17. [a.] incusavit, ‘he rated them vigorously.'
1. 18. [3.] sibi quaerendum . . putarent, ‘because, in a general way, they thought it their business to enquire where their commander was leading them.'
1. 19. [4.] Ariovistum: as to this particular case, there was no reason to expect war with Ariovistus.
1. 34. [5.] quod si bellum intulisset, ‘ if he did attack them, what in the world were they afraid of?'
1. 35. [6.] de sua virtute aut, de ipsius diligentia, ‘their own valour or the accuracy of his arrangements.*

1. 30. [9.] servili tumultu, i.e. ‘in bello servorum;’ whence the ‘quos'which follows. Cic. Phil. 8. 1, defines ‘tumultus:' ‘Majores nostri tumultum Italicum quod erat domesticus; tumultum Gallicum quod erat Italiae finitimus; praeterea nullum nominabant.' The war here mentioned was that with Spartacus and his gladiators, B.C. 73. See Bell. Civ. 1. 14, note 4.
1. 30. [10.] quos tamen is equivalent to ‘ quamvis eos sublevarent.' Hence the subjunctive in * accepissent.'

[17.] quod non fore dicto audientes, ‘as to its being said that his soldiers would mutiny/
1. 20 [18.] aut male re gesta, &c., * such commanders had either suffered reverses and had been defeated, or their habits of peculation had been brought clearly home to them (* convictam ’) by some flagrant instance/ Caesar is referring, not to the celebrated mutinies of Roman history (Liv. 2. 59, 4. 49, 28. 29), but to matters of his own experience.
1. 23. [19.] quod . . collaturus fuisset, * he would do at once what he should otherwise have put off for some time/ * Repraesentare ’ is a legal term meaning * to ante-date/
1. 28. [20.] cum sola decima legione. Observe the excellence of this speech. It is quiet and ratiocinative (and therefore, as given, almost entirely retains the regular oblique tenses); yet the topics are of the unquestionable character which alone can convince a blind panic. After displaying these briefly but fully, he returns to his favourite mode of thought and expression;—there will be no mutiny, because he has not deserved any (chap. 14, init.), and he ends by a bold rhetorical declaration that he is ready to march with the tenth legion only. (Bacon, Adv. of Learning, Book I, ad fin., gives other admirable instances of Caesar’s power of eloquence.) By the ‘ praetoria cohors * is meant * the general’s personal guard/
1. 31; [c. 41. n. 1.] conversae sunt omnium mentes; the fact being that the tenth legion gave the impulse, and the others were ashamed to remain behind. So in Xen. Anab. 1. 4. 16 Clearchus induces his own men to cross the Euphrates first and thus overcomes the unwillingness of the other divisions.
1. 33* [2.] innata est, understand * omnium mentibus/
P. 25.1. 1. [3.] optimum .iudicium, &c.* ‘because he had judged them in a way so highly honourable/
1. 4. [4.] egerunt uti . . satisfacerent, ‘tried all means to satisfy Caesar/ By ‘ summa belli * is meant the general management of the war.
1. 8. [5.] ex aliis, ‘ Gallis * understood; the word is added in several MSS.
1. 9. [6.] circuitu locis apertis ; in order to guard against all risk of a recurrence of the panic; not trusting too completely to their newfound valour. See 43, note 1.
1. 10. [7.] cum iter non intermitteret, &c., * on the seventh day of unbroken marching/ The ablative absolute would be the more natural construction. See 1. 1, note 8.
[c. 42. n. 1.] id per se fieri licere, ‘ that this might now take place, as far as he was concerned/
1.16. [2.] condicionem, &c., * Caesar did not refuse the terms of agreement offered.*NOTES. BOOK I, CHAP. 43.
[3.] polliceretur. The literal sense of this compound must be gained from that of the simple 4 liceor * (chap. 18, note 3). According to this * proliceor ’ would mean 4 to leave (or allow) forward from oneself,* that is, 4 to offer.*
[4.] in spem veniebat,4 he began to entertain hope.*
1. 20. [5.] fore uti desisteret; chap. 10, note 2.
1. 22. [6.] ultro citroque, 4 backwards and forwards.* Mr. Long has well remarked that this phrase proves that 'ultro’ is connected with 4 ultra ’ and not immediately with the verb 4 volo.*
1. 25. [7.] uterque veniret; chap. 36, note .7.
1. 26. [8.] interposita causa, 4 by allowing difficulties or excuses to intervene.*
1. 31. [9.] quam amicissimum, &c,, 'guards as devoted as possible.*
1. 31. [10.] si quid opus facto esset; this appears to be a mixture of the two common constructions 4 si quid opus est,* if anything is needful (a need), and 4 si facto (or factu) opus est,* if there is need of action. Observe that4 quid ’ alone is the subject,4 opus ’ the predicate.
P. 20. 1. 1. [11.] cohors praetoria, ‘the cohort of the praetorium,* that is, of head-quarters. They were to supply the guards and escorts required by Caesar.
1. 2. [12.] ad equum rescribere,4 he was making them knights on horseback.* The joke is more pointed in Latin. Mr. Long remarks on the difficulty of making men riders extempore; but Vegetius (1. 18) asserts that, even up to his time,4 salitio equorum non tironibus modo, sed etiam militibus districte est semper exacta.* The context shews that he means infantry. If we suppose that Vegetius, as in some other cases, is here drawing on his own imagination, the feat of the Germans in teaching navvies to ride adequately in three days for the purpose of blowing down the bridge at Bitche is a notable instance of the possibility of doing what Caesar does here.
1. 2. [o. 43. n. t.] planicies magna. Caesar made a rapid march from Tonnerre to Besan9on (chap. 38). Then, avoiding the mountainous and wooded country on the direct line by Montbeliard, he went by a detour of fifty miles by Pennesiferes and Vallerois les Bois to Arcey. At this place, after four days* march, he resumed the direct road to the Rhine by Belfort, as far as Cemay. Arriving there on the 7th day he found himself within twenty-four miles of Ariovistus, who was encamped near Colmar. The plain was the one crossed by the rivers 111 and Thur.
[2.] sua senatusque beneficia; chap. 33, note 5.
[3.] munera amplissime, ‘gifts of the most dignified character.* Livy, 30. 15, tells us that these gifts consisted of a golden crown and cup, an ivory curule chair and sceptre, and embroidered robes.NOTES. BOOK 7, CHAP. 44.
[4.] ea praemia consecutum, « those honours/ (Comp. Virg. Aen. 1. 461). These arguments seem to be rather from a Roman point of view. The turn of this last phrase, if literally spoken by Caesar, must have been offensive to Ariovistus, as implying that he had obtained this recognition by suing for it.
[5.] docebat etiam, * he then proceeded to inform him/
[6.] ut .. Aedui tenuissent, • how completely the Aedui had held the first place in Gaul/
1. 23. [7.] quod vero ad amicitiam p. B. attulissent: how far Rome observed this law herself, we see from the fact that in B.C. 100 some lands in Cisalpine Gaul were confiscated on the pretence that they had been conquered by the Cimbri. This Thierry (5. 2. init.) rightly calls «an odious and impolitic measure/
1. 30. [c. 44. n. 1.] sua sponte; chap. 9, note 2.
1. 31. [2.] non sine magna spe magnisque praemiis, 'not without high hopes and inducements.*
P. 27.1. 10. [3.] idque se ea spe petisse—mark the neuter: ‘and that he had aimed at the whole thing with this object/
[4.] non minus libenter, &c., ‘he would cast away the friendship of the Roman people not less readily than he had sought for it/ The stronger tenses used in the dramatic oblique express strongly the peremptory energy of Ariovistus* manner.
1. 13. [5.] quod, .traducat, ‘as for his bringing over hordes of Germans.’
1. 19. [6.] quid sibi vellet P see chap. 14, note 4, the oblique of ‘quid tibi vis?*
1. 20. [7.] hano Galliam, ‘this part of Gaul.* The word ‘provinciam’ implies very forcibly that Ariovistus considered himself not merely to have conquered, but to have incorporated his Gallic territory.
1. 21. [8.] ut ipsi concedi non oporteret. The expression in the oratio directa would have been ‘ut mihi concedi non oporteret’ (conditional)—‘ as it would not be right to give way to me/ ‘ Ut ipsi concedi non oportere’ would stand for * as it is not right to give way to me/
1. 24. [9.] imperitum rerum, «unversed in political matters.*
1. 25. [10.] bello Allobrogum proximo. B.C. 62; see Thierry, 5, 2 (vol. 2, p. 62). It followed immediately after their revelation of Catiline’s conspiracy.

1. 29. [12.] quod exercitum in Gallia habeat, lit. * in that he has an army in Gaul,’ (now that) : cp. 14, note 5.
1. 32. [13.] quodsi eum interfecerit; these were not mere threats. Cic. ad Div. 8. 1, shows us the feeling with which reports of disaster to Caesar were received at Rome; and this very year was the one whenNOTES. BOOK 7, CHAP. 45-47.	2.35
Clodius, under Caesar’s patronage, got Cicero exiled, in spite of the sympathy of 20,000 citizens.

1. 9. [2.] neque se iudicare, ‘nor could he admit/
1. 10. [3.] Arvernos et Butenos. The war here alluded to was in B.C. 121. These nations had not been united to the province, because this was naturally bounded by the Cevennes, and could not easily embody them.
[4.] quibus—from this relative, ‘eos * must be understood after ‘redegisset/ as in chap. 37,note 4.
[5.] antiquissimum quodque tempus, ‘ priority of time/ So Cicero says ‘ antiquissimae cuique (epistolae) respondebo/ ‘ I will answer each of your letters in proportion as it is older* (in the order of their arrival).
1. 16. [6.] quam suis legibus uti voluisset, &c., ‘ since the senate, after overthrowing the country in war, had chosen that it should live under its own laws/
[o. 40. n. 1.] dum haec geruntur: the present ind. is generally governed by ‘ dum,’ even when the principal verb is strongly in a past tense. So Livy 21. 29, ‘dum elephanti traiiciuntur, Hannibal quingentos equites ad castra Romana miserat speculatum/ and Hor. Carm.
1. 10, II,
‘ Voce dum terret, viduus pharetra ' Risit Apollo/
[2.] propius tumulum, the comparative governing the same case as the positive ‘ prope/
[3.] in nostros, the pronoun repeated to avoid ‘ eos,’ referring to a word in the same sentence; comp. 8, note 3, and * suos . . suisque/ just below.
1. 23. [4.] committendum; chap. 13, note 5.
1. 24. [5.] per fidem, i.e. ‘fide data adductos/ (Kraner.) Better perhaps like ‘ per inducias/ * at a time when a guarantee had been given.’
1. 26. [6.] omni Gallia Bomanis interdixisset, that is, had wished to confine them to the province, and to keep the rest of Gaul tributary to himself. The ablative as^n • interdicere aqua et igni/

[6.] quid ad se venirent; see 1. 14, note 4.
[7.] conclamavit: he cried out for all to hear.
1. 17. [o. 48. n. I.] castra promovit; first to a spot close upon the Vosges near Feldkirch; and then on the following day to a hill near Reiningen. This last was a decisive movement; for a general who falls thus on his adversary’s communications must mean to force him to fight.
1. 27. [2.] genus hoc erat pugnae, &c., 1 the following was the method of cavalry fighting practised by the Germans.* v 1. 30. [3.] singuli singulos; in order that the influences of friendship might come in. This mixed arrangement produced what Caesar admires in the British chariots (4. 33), 4 mobilitatem equitum, stabilitatem peditum/ and he seems to have used this German mode of fighting among his own German auxiliaries. See 7. 13, and Bell. Civ. 3. 84. For ^particularly clumsy misuse of them, see ib. 2. 34.

[c. 50. n. 1.] instituto suo; [chap. 4, note 2.] Abi. normae.
1. 20. [2.] exercitum in castra reduxit. Caesar’s main object in forming two different camps was to gain possession of the roads both north and south; so that Ariovistus could not escape without fighting. Besides this, such an arrangement tempted the Germans strongly to an attack on the entrenchments, which would be sure to give an advantage to the Romans. Lastly, it gave an opportunity for the stratagem to be described in 51, note 1. See Jules C£sar, plate 16.
1. 28. [3.] sortibus; twigs inscribed witfc signs of the various alternatives proposed (Tacit. Germ. 10), 4 vaticinationibus/'taken from the noise of waters, the eddies of rivers, &c. (Plut. Caesar 19.)
1. 29. [4.] ©x usu, 4 expedient*
1. 30. [5.] ante novam lunam: so the Spartans refused to help the Athenians at Marathon till the full moon (Herod. 6.106). The new and the full moon were their auspicious days (Tacit. Germ. 11). The feeling at the bottom of this is thus explained by Winer Realw. (Neumondj:NOTES. BOOK 7, CHAP. 51-53,
* For simple nations the .first new light of the moon is most cheering and joyful. From its appearance they also obtain the order of the months, and, in the absence of astronomical observations, that of the whole civil and religious year.*
1. 33. [o. 51. n. 1.] omnis alarios. Leaving in each camp a small Roman force, Caesar drew up his alarii (the auxilia of chap. 49) before the smaller camp, in such a manner as to make it appear that the two legions were there still. But, meanwhile, these legions had been withdrawn, and crossing the space of three miles, unobserved by the enemy, had joined the four legions belonging to the larger camp, and made an attack on Ariovistus’ position before he could call in his detachments. Of course the successful execution of such a stratagem depended largely upon the perfect steadiness behind ramparts of the two legions who had first occupied the smaller camp (thus being left in the rear), and then executed the hazardous movement from camp to camp. This explanation is due to Jules C6sar, vol. 2, p. 91.
P. 31.1.1. [2.] quod minus valebat. Thus Nipperdey and Kraner wish to read, but for the more authorised reading ‘quo minus,’ see 4. 2, note 1, and compare the Greek positive foqnrep d\yw, Soph. Trach. 313.
1. 12. [o. 52. n. 1.] quaestorem, properly, a civil and finance officer, but available for command (5. 25, note 4).
1. 13. [2.] a dextro cornu, * by his own right wing,' the enemy’s left, which was occupied by the Harudes.
[3.] phalange facta, ‘ who had rapidly adopted the phalanx formation,’ that is, one in dense bodies of from 300 to 400 men (Jules C£sar, p. 92). Orosius' explanation is, that they formed a kind of tortoise, with their shields over their heads; and that some of the Roman soldiers sprang actually on this roof of shields. But this seems improbable; for such a defensive arrangement would be suicidal as a mode of resisting an attack with swords, although it might answer as against javelins.
1. 21. [4.] scuta manibus revellerent; instead of following the ordinary practice of pushing their shields under that of their enemy, and wounding him from beneath (which they could do without abandoning their own guard), they grasped the top of the enemies’ shields and struck from above.

WAR ON THE AISNE. BATTLE OF THE SAMBRE.
Page 1. line i. [chap. 1. note 1.] in hibernis. Most editors omit these words on the ground that * hibema ’ always means the winter quarters of an army engaged in a war.
1. 3. [2.] Belgas. The name Belgae is thought by Zeuss to mean * warriors,* (Gr. Celt p. 140). They were, as remarked in the notes to 1.1, a later body of immigrants. Caesar considers them a German tribe, probably because they immigrated by the Rhine, beyond which he knew only Germans; modem authorities are entirely in favour of considering them Gauls. Some of the strongest arguments for this conclusion are that they colonised the South-East of Britain, which was unquestionably not German; and that the names of their towns have the true Gallic endings, ‘dunum,’ ‘briva,* and ‘magus.* StrangelyNOTES. BOOK II, CHAP. 1-3,
enough the Volcae of Languedoc, though living so far to the south of the main seats of their nation, are thought to be a Belgian tribe; their name being held to be only another form of Belgae. Strabo confusedly imagines that they reach to the Loire, but Zeuss (die Deutschen, p. 188) strongly argues for Caesar’s view that the Seine and Marne are their real boundary.

1. 7. [5.] exercitus noster adduceretur. The Belgae, according to this passage, feared (1) Annexation, (2) Foreign garrisons, (3) Repression of irregular native greatness founded on birth or wealth. Besides this, their natural ‘ levitas * of mind rendered them insensible to the blessings of Roman rule, and anxious for change even for its own sake. History repeats itself; as Indian events constantly show us.
1. 8. [6.] partim qui. Instead of repeating the adverb three times, Caesar substitutes ‘ ab nonnullis etiam ’ for the last class enumerated.

But his conclusions hardly agree With those of the highest German authorities.

1. 33. [6.] Axonam, the Aisne, a tributary of the Oise. Caesar, coming from Durocortorum (or Reims) the capital of the Remi, crossed the river by the bridge at Berry-au-Bac, close to the celebrated modem battle-fields of Laon and Craonne, and marched to Bibrax (Vieux Laon) mentioned in the next chapter. He encamped on the hill of Mau- champ, with the marshes of the little river Miette in front, and commanding the road from Reims to Laon. His camp was therefore covered in the rear (‘unum latus*) by the river Aisne; and he secured his communication with Reims by a tite de port at Berry-au-Bac, and by a detachment of 3,000 men under Sabinus. The trace of all Caesar’s work here has been discovered through the excavations skilfully directed by the author of Jules C&ar: see vol. 2, p. 101, and map 8 in the atlas.

So we have ‘ res fruenda oculis,’ ‘ utenda vasa/ and the like: but, with rare exceptions, this licence is used only in the case of the future in * -dus.’ 1. 32. [3.] ab milibus passuum minus duobus, hyperbaton * cp. i. 6, note 3, * less than two miles off.*
P. 37. 1. 2. [o. 8. n. 1.] eximiam opinionem, &c., ‘their preeminent reputation for valour.*
1. 3. [2.] proelio supersedere. The word ‘supersedeo* means, primarily, ‘to sit over* in the sense of presiding; as Cato R. R. 5. 1,
4 vilicus litibus familiae supersedeatthen probably ‘ to sit over a thing* as passing it over; whence the common meaning, ‘ to delay.*
1. 4. [3.] quid hostis virtute posset: see 1. 36, note 8; and below, ‘ tantum multitudine poterant.’
L 6. [4.] loco pro castris, &c., ‘ he chose a place before his camp which lay near enough and was suitable for forming a line of battle; and, as the hill on which his camp was placed rose to a small height from the plain, with just frontage enough for an army in battle array, and towards the front sloped gently back to the level after rising to a slight eminence, whilst its flanks were slightly precipitous, he carried from each flank of the hill a ditch ending in a redoubt.’ It is difficult to understand this passage clearly. The excavations seem to prove that one of these ditches ran from the south-east angle of the camp to the Aisne, the other from the north-west angle nearly to the Miette. But this would be placing them both on the right of the position; whereas the text seems to indicate that they guarded both flanks; and, taking it alone, we should certainly think that they were drawn at right angles to the right and left of Caesar’s line, and on both sides towards the enemy. Perhaps the solution may be that the two ditches given in plate 8 to Jules C6sar, together constituted the right-hand ditch of the two mentioned by Caesar (their combined length would have been about 600 paces); and another similar ditch (effaced or not discovered) may have been drawn at right angles to the left of the position, crossing from river to river, in a length of 600 paces, as the eastern one did, by the help of the intervening camp. The word * transversam* seems of itself to imply that the ditches crossed the axis of the hill.
1. 21. [o. 9. n. 1.] si nostri transirent, * to see if our men would cross itso ubi neutri .'. faciunt, ‘ when it appeared that neither side would take the initiative/NOTES. BOOK II, CHAP. IO-I4.	243

Madvig lays down, as a general rule, that determinative pronouns are used for reflexives only in a dependent clause where the subject differs from that of the main clause: as in 1. 5, * Persuadent Rauracis uti eodem usi consilio una cum iis proficiscantur;' and 1. 11, ‘ita se de populo Romano meritos esse ut liberi eorum in servitutem abduci non debuerint.’ Either, therefore, 'eorum' is to be omitted in this passage, or there is a slight carelessness in the construction.

[o. 29. n. i.] unum oppidum, the city of Aduatum, as may be seen by the map at p. 65, was situated on a plateau at the junction of the Sambre and Meuse, now the citadel of Namur, and therefore not far from the field of Waterloo. The line of cireumvallation was carried across the angle formed by the two rivers.

COMBAT OF MARTIGNY. SEAFIGHT OF QUIBERON.
INROAD INTO AQUITAINE.
P. 50.1. 2. [o. 1. n. i.] in Nantuatis. The two legions levied by Caesar in Italy for the Belgian campaign, and which were sent by the Great St. Bernard under the charge of Q. Pedius (2. 2), had according to Strabo been treacherously attacked by the Salassi in ascending from the Val d'Aosta. This expedition was intended to check the mountain tribes. The Nantuates were in the present French Savoy, the Veragri in the Lower Valais, and the Seduni in Upper Valais, from Sion to the Rhone Glacier. Sitten or Sion is named from them.
1. 5. [2.] magno cum periculo, * but only with great danger/
1. 9. [3.] secundis... proeliis factis; observe (as in 2. 30, note 2) the succession in time in these ablatives absolute. First the battles and sieges; then the sending of hostages; then the peace; and lastly the resolution to send soldiers to Sixt on the one hand, and Martigny (Octodurus) on the other.
P. 51.1. 4. [c. 2. n. 1.] montes; the lower heights immediately bordering the valley. Caesar uses this word for the cliffs of Kent; for the low hills near Autun; and in this chapter for eminences from which a javelin can be thrown. He also applies the term to the ranges of the Jura or Cevennes.
L 5. [2.] id ... ut... Galli ... consilium caperent; the objective * sentence in apposition with the pronoun. See 1. 4, note 4.
1. 9. [3.] singillatim, 4 in small parties/
[4.] ex montibus... decurrerent; as they themselves had high ground to charge and throw their missiles from.
1.14. [5.] obsidum nomine, 4 as hostages/ so 4 obsidum loco/ What is the literal meaning of4 nomen ’ ?
1. 25. [c. 3. n. 1.] subsidio, i.e. 4 subsidii loco/ lit. ‘by way of assistance.
1. 29. [2.] ad salutem contenderent, 4 they should march to a place of safety/ So 4 contendere ad Vesontionem' (1. 38) means ‘to reach Besanyon ;* 4 oculo contendere/ * to reach with the eyesight4 ut magis virtute quam dolo contenderent/ 4 rather to do their work by valour than by stratagem* (1. 13).
1. 30. [3.] hoo reservato ... consilio, &c., * to reserve this plan, and in the meantime to wait for results and defend their camp/
1. 32. [c. 4. n. 1.] vix ut; hyperbaton for 4 ut vix/ Cp. 1. 9, 4 vix qua singuli carri ducerentur/NOTES. BOOK 111\ CHAP. 5-7.	251
P. 52.1. 2. [a.] integris viribus, ■ so long as their strength remained unbroken.*
1. 3. [3.] ex loco superiore, * since the ground on which they stood was higher/ Prepositional ablative absolute: cp. 1. 33, ‘in tanto imperio;* 2. 22, ‘in tanta rerum iniquitate/
1. 5. [4.] sed hoc superari, ‘ but in this point they found themselves constantly overmatched; * whence the infinitive.

8. [7.] non modo; elliptic for * non modo non/ The full expression in 2. 17.

[2.] languidioribus nostris, the dativus incommodi: translate

1. 21. [5.] paulisper, ‘for a short time;* ‘parumper* is more often used when future time is meant, as here.
1. 26. [c. 0. n. i.] sui colligendi; the gerundive is singular, though
sui* is plural as referring to ‘ hostibus/ Cp. Cic. Phil. 5. 3, * facultas agrorum suis latronibus condonandi/
L 27. [2.] potiundorum castrorum; cp. 2. 7, note 2.
1. 32. [3.] fusis armisque exutis, both participles agree with ‘ hostium copiis/ and ‘ armis’ is the ablative of material; 4 the forces of the enemy being routed and stripped of their arms.* 4 Hostem armis exuere’ is, as Kraner remarks, so frequent an expression that the awkwardness of the ablative on ablative is not felt. So Cicero places the dative and ablative, de Sen. 22, ‘ quemadmodum patribus male rem gerentibus bonis interdici solet/
P. 53. 1.1. [4.] alio se ... OQnsilio venisse, &c., literally, ‘that he had come into winter quarters with one intention, but had found the actual circumstances quite different from this (incompatible with this)/
1. 6. [5.] Allobroges; the nation lying along a line from Vienne to Geneva, between the Rhone and Isfcre: cp. 1. 10, where they are mentioned as being in the Roman province. As soon as Galba had crossed the Tete Noire, he would have a comparatively level march by Chamonix to Sallenches, and so to Vienne.
1. 8. [c. 7. n. 1.] omnibus de causis, &c., 4 Caesar thought for all realms that Gaul was subdued (4 pacatam * is euphemistic); since the Belgae had been defeated,’ &c.2$%	NOTES. BOOK III, CHAP. 8, 9.
1. 9. [2.] expulsis Germanis, those of Ariovistus. Kraner argues that these cannot be meant, as only the last year’s events are here alluded to. But Caesar’s meaning seems to be that he could go safely into Illyricum, as Gaul was not likely to rise of itself, and the two disturbing causes of the Belgae and Ariovistus were now at rest, besides which the communication with his province was secure, as the Seduni had been reduced.
11.	[3.] regiones cognoscere, ‘to ascertain the character of the country.'
[4.] P. Crassus adulescens; P. Crassus the younger, son of the triumvir, and the friend of Cicero (Ep. ad Qu. Frat. 2. 9).
[5.] proximus mare, the construction imitated from ‘ prope mare;' so with the comparative in ‘ plus dena milia passuum abesse,9 and the like phrases.
[6>] Andes, * Anjou.'
1. 18. [7.] Curiosolitae, round Dinan and S. Malo. Several MSS. read ‘ Venelli * for * Esuvii/ which the author of Jules Cesar follows. The sense thus given is better; for the Esuvii were in eastern Normandy about Falaise, whereas the Venelli, occupying the Cotentin from Avranches to Cape la Hogue, are more naturally involved in this Breton war. The three nations here named extend quite across the peninsula of Bretagne.
[8.] Veneti, near Vannes, in Bretagne.
1. 20. [o. 8. n. 1.] longe amplissima... omnis orae, ‘very great indeed over all that line of coast/ ‘Longe’ with the superlative is generally in Caesar the superlative absolute.
L 23. [2.] in magno impetu maris atque aperto, ‘ being on an open sea of great impetuosity.' By a similar hypallage we have • mitis sapientia Laeli/ ‘ the gentle and wise Laelius/
L 26. [3.] ab his initium fit retinendi, &c., * these took the initiative by detaining Silius and Velanius.'
1. 28. [4.] ut sunt Gallorum subita... consilia, * as, in point of feet, the resolutions of the Gauls are generally sudden and unforeseen ;* ‘ ut ’ here introduces an illustrative assertion of a general fact.
32‘ [5*] eundem ... fortunae exitum.. .laturos, ‘they resolved; that they would share in common any result which might occur.'
1. 33. [6.J quam a maioribus acceperant; why not ‘accepissent’?
P. 54.1. 4. [7.] obsides sibi remittat, oblique imperative, when the oblique takes the dramatic form so as to retain the tenses used by the speaker. Otherwise the imperfect would be used, as in I. 36, * cum vellet congrederetur/ ‘ let him attack when he chose.'

meaning is, ‘ were informed of Caesar’s arrival as soon as it was known/ Kraner and Nipperdey omit * certiores facti/
L ii. [3.] quantum in ae faoinus admisissent; this is the full phrase for which the usual abridgement is * admittere facinus/ ‘ to commit a crime/
1. ia. [4.] legatos ... retentos, in apposition to ‘facinus;* namely,
• that they had detained some ambassadors/
[5.] quod nomen, ‘ whose very name and character/
[6.] natura looi, ‘ in the character erf their territories/
19. [7.] neque nostros... apud se morari posse oonfldebant, ‘and they trusted that our men would not be able to stay among them/
1. 21. [8.] ut omnia acciderent, &c„ * even granting that everything happened contrary to their expectation/
1. 22. [9.] se plurimum navibus posse; cp. 1. 36, note 8.
1. 25. [10.] atque in Oceano, &c., * that the navigation was very different in the ocean from what it would be in a close sea ’ (like the Mediterranean). Observe the inversion of the ideas in Latin.
1. 30. [11.] Ambiliati, &c. These are mainly the coast nations as far as the Scheldt. The name of the * Lexovii * remains in4 Lisieux ;* that of the ‘ Diablintres ’ in ‘ Jablinsthat of the ‘Namnetes’ in ‘ Nantes/
P. 55.1.1. [0.10. n. 1.] iniuriae retentorum equitum, ‘the wrong done in detaining the knights/ The genitive of definition.
1. 3. [2.] imprimis ne hac parte neglecta, * and above all the apprehension that if he did not attend to this partial rising the other states would think that they might do the same.’ According to Strabo, 4.162, the Breton nations already suspected Caesar’s design of passing into Britain, and wished to hinder it that they might retain the monopoly of its commerce. But they were probably allied with the great Belgian confederacy; a new rising of which they now hoped to head. Hence the mission of Labienus just below into the country of the Remi and the other Belgic tribes.
[0.11. n. 1.] numero equitatus; cp. 1.18, note 4.
[a.] Aquitania, the country from the Garonne to the Pyrenees; occupied, as the south slope of the Pyrenees is also, by the Basque population. For their character and language, see Prichard, Hist, of Mankind, vol. 3, p. 20. This learned writer points out that Basque (or Iberian) districts may be known by the occurrence of the syllables ‘ast/ a rock, ‘uria,* a town, ‘itur/ a fountain, and some others. Thus Calagurris, Asturia, Turiga, would be Basque names. For the character of the people, see Michelet, Hist, de France, vol. *, p. aga.
L 15. [3.] in Aquitaniam; that is, to *weep the country from the 'NOTES. BOOK III, CHAP. 12, 13«
Loire to the Garonne, and then, if necessary, to cross the latter river into Aquitania. The Aquitanians were (except the Bituriges') of such a different stock from the Belgae and Armoricans, that they were not likely to join their confederacy. But Caesar probably did not know this: and thus the present may have seemed to him a favourable opportunity for pushing his arms into the only part of Gaul to which the Roman standards had not yet penetrated. Crassus* cavalry, too, would have been useless in a Breton war; and were therefore available for other purposes. It should be remarked that the Aquitanian tribes did not join even in the great revolt of Book vii; and their connections were far more with Spain than with Gaul, see below, chap. 20: while the Armori- cans on their side, as Merivale remarks (vol. i, p. 343), took little interest in southern affairs.
1. 24. [c. 12. n. 1.] situs oppidoram; of these localities the Mont St. Michael in Normandy, and St Michael’s Mount in Cornwall, would be good examples.
L 27. [2.] horarum XXIV spatio; this is an emendation for xii, it being held that Caesar could not possibly make such a mistake as to imagine two tides in twelve hours. Probably this is true: yet we may remember Dr. Arnold’s remark on Bede’s belief that there were tides seven times a day in the Solent (Lectures on Modem Hist P- 13»)
L 28. [3.] naves ... afflictarentur, &c., 4 as the tide went down, any vessels would get bumped on the shore.* ( Minuo * is here used intransitively.
L 28. [4.] utraque re, * under either alternative,* 1. 4, note 1.
1. 29. [5.] ae si quando... superati, &c. Remark the way in which the participles must here go into verbs in English ; ‘ if they were ever baffled by the extent of our works, and began to despair because moles had been carried right up to their walls, then they would bring up a number of Vessels and so transport themselves to' some neighbouring town.’ Caesar can be well translated only in this way.
P. 56. L 4. [6.] vasto, mari, &c.; these are ablatives absolute; 4 where the sea was so open and inhospitable,* &c.
1.8. [d. 13. n. i,] vada... excipere, &c., * that they might be the better able to take the shallows at low water.* By * carinae ’ is meant 4 the hulls,* not4 the keels.*
L 12. [a.] transtra; the decks (not benches) were of beams a foot thick fastened with bolts as thick as one’s thumb.
[3.] tantas tempestates Oceani,4so tempestuous an ocean;* so with the following words, and cp. 3. 8, note 2, for the hypallage.
1. 18. [4.] non satis commode posse, &c., * they thought that it would be impossible to keep ships of such burthen under canvas.* Litotes (see 1.18, note 8). 'Caesar has a natural disinclination to use theNOTES.	BOOK III,	CHAP.	14.	255
word1 impossible,’ like Napoleon, who said, • Impossible! ne me dites jamais cette bSte de mot.!
1. 20. [5.] pro loci natura, • considering the character of the scene of action.’
1. 25. [6.] ventus coepisset et se vento dedissent. Cp. 1. 8, note 3, (‘ei’ for 'vento* would have been inelegant; especially as ‘vento se dare ’ is a well-known phrase).
1. 28. [7.] quarum rerum ... casus, ‘ whereas our ships had to fear all these contingent perils.*
1. 31. [0. 14. n. 1.] statuit exspectandam classem,' he made up his mind that he must wait for his fleet.'
1. 3a. [2.] quae ubi convenit; they appear to have sallied from the river Auray as soon as the approach of the Romans from the Loire was signalled to them. The battle took place in the bay of Quiberon, and was viewed by Caesar from the heights of S. Gildas. Considering the superiority of the Breton fleet in number and equipment, this victory of the Romans is a real master-stroke. The defeat of the expedition sent from England under Puisaye in 1795 has attached, as regards ourselves, very different memories to the same spot.
1. 32. [3.] primum; understand ‘ubi,’ * as soon as it was seen by the enemy.’
F. 57.1. 3. [4 ] quibus ... naves erant attributae,' who had taken charge of the several vessels.*
5- [5-] quam rationem pugnae insisterent, • what plan of fighting they were to adqpt.*
1. 6. [6.] turribus... excitatis, ‘ even if they raised their deck towers.’ One of these towers is figured at p. 784 of Smith’s Classical Dictionary.
1. 7. [7.] ex barbaris navibus 5 * the height of the bulwarks on the side of the foreign vessels.’
1. 7. [8.] ex inferiore loco; since, on the one hand, the place from which they were cast was so much lower; (for this prepositional abl. absolute, see 1. 33, note 3), and, on the other, those sent by the Gauls fell more heavily. Considering the weight of a Roman javelin, it is evident that it must have made the greatest possible difference whether gravity acted for or against it.
1. 9. [9.] una erat magno usui res; Caesar really means to say that without these hooks the battle would not have been won (cp. 7. 41): but the Roman military instinct avoids even the remotest suggestion of possible defeat or failure.
1.11. [10.] non absimili forma muralium falcium; understand * formae.' The * murales falces’ were used for pulling down an enemy’s turf wall.
[11.] navigio remis incitato, * the ship was got sharply under way.'
[12.] positum ©rat in virtute, ‘ depended on yalour.*NOTES. BOOK III, CHAP. 15-17
1. 19. [13.] nullum paullo fortius factum, * no action at all distinguished / understand ' solito.*
1. 24. [0.15. n. 1.] contendebant...contenderunt. See I. 53, note
Here the meaning is, • managed to board/ ‘ endeavoured to save themselves by flight*
1. 28. [2.] malacia, fiaKaxia.
1. 31. [3.] ut perpaucae ... ad terram pervenerint. Other editions read ‘ pervenirent/ The perfect lays more stress on the fact as occurring at a given point of time, the imperfect on its being a consequence of the preceding proposition. So we have (Cic. de Fin. 2. 20), * Thorius erat ita non timidus ad mortem, ut in acie sit ob rempublicam interfectus/ * Thorius feared death so little that he was killed in battle for the state/
1. 33. [4.] cum... pugnaretur, ‘ since the battle had been going on;' (praeteritum ad praesens; see 3. 5, note 1).
1. 33. [5.] ab hora...quarta; as these events happened about the end of the summer, the first hour would have been about 6 a.m. In winter the military reckoning of hours would have begun about two hours later, and in summer about two hours earlier. See M. Leverrier’s Table; Jules Cesar, vol. 2, app.
P. 58.1. 4. [0.10. n. 1.] navium quod ubique fuerat, * all the ships that they had anywhere had / partitive genitive.
1. 9« M quo diligentius, &c.t ‘ that they might observe more accurately the law of embassies/ So (diligentia' is used in 1. 40, note; and constantly.
1. 9. [3.] a barbaris, * by these barbariansthat is, 1 in spite of their barbarism/
[4.] reliquos sub corona vendidit; this can hardly mean that Caesar sold the whole nation by auction. The mention of the senate makes it probable that the inhabitants of the capital, Dariorigum, are meant. Even so the rigour is terrible; and the more so, as regards the senate, from the grim alternative which the next chapter suggests, as the only one open to these unfortunate rulers.
1.13. [o. 17. n. i.] Venellorum; this is the true reading of which Unelli is a corruption. See Gliick, Keltische Namen (in voce). Observe that1 Aulerci Eburovices' is one name, * the Aulerci of Evreuxso the Lexovii gave their name to Lisieux.
[2.] exercitum magnasque copies, * an army and considerable war material.' * Copias' cannot mean large supplies; for these were deficient (c. 18). But it is difficult to understand it, as Kraner does, of irregular forces.
[3.] his paucis diebus, * within the present (same) few days.' So Livy has, 4 in hac magnificentia urbis/ 4 amid the present magnificence of the city/NOTES.	BOOK III\	CHAP.	18,19,
1. 22. [4.] idoneo omnibus rebus; I. 4, note r.
1. 24. [5.] duum milium; passuum is omitted with the genitive plural. * Duum,* an antique form; like the genitives ‘ drachmum/
* nummum/ • talentum/ 4 amphorum/ which follow numerals. It is seldom used unless * milium * follows.
1. a 6. [6.] militum vocibus, 4 in our soldiers’ talk/

1* 5* [3.] neque longius abesse quin, *and that no later than the next night Sabinus would lead his forces out/ As 4 quin * is an abridgement for 4 qui non* (ut non), the literal rendering would be, 4 nor was it farther distant so that Sabinus should not lead his troops out on the next night/
[4.] superiorum dierum, is gen. of definition. 4 Sabini' is subjective genitive. Other successive genitives are (1. 30) 4 Helvetiorum iniuriae populi Romani/ and (1. 19), ‘sine ejus offensione animi/ See the notes at these chapters.
1. 12. [5.] spes Venetici belli; subjective genitive, 'the hopes which they built on the Venetic war/
[6.] et quod libenter credunt, ‘and the fact that men are generally willing to believe/

1. 29. [5.] magnum numerum eorum; the demonstrative 'eorum' was usually omitted after ‘quos/ Caesar retains it, as in 1. 12, ‘eoa aggressus magnum numerum eorum occidit' (Kraner).

P. 60. L 5. [c. 20. n. i.] quae pars . . ex tertia parte» * which section of Gaul is to be considered as a third of the whole country.*
* Ex tertia parte * means * on the footing of a third part,' like ‘ haeres ex asse/ *a sole legatee/ ‘ex facili/ ‘easily.’ As to the exaggerated size of Aquitania, we may remark that Caesar appears to have thought that the Garonne has a general course running more to the northward than it really has. He places Aquitania, in 1.1, to the north*west of the Roman provinces; whereas its general position would be better described by saying that it lies west and south-west of the Provincia. It is true that this description is founded on the direction of the Upper Garonne (see the note on I. Ibut this would not sufficiently account for the over estimate.
L 8. [a.] paucis ante annis; hyperbaton; see 1.6,note 3, and other references in the index.
1. 8. [3.] Praeooninus, Mallius; these had been generals sent against Sertorius, B.C. 78, and defeated by his lieutenants in Aquitania.
[4.] Tolosa, Narbone et Carcassone is the reading of early editions. The third name is omitted on the ground, first, that copulatives are not used to couple the second and third member only as in English; and secondly, that Carcassonne became important only in the middle ages. The first reason would not of itself justify the omission of ‘ Carcassone/ as Caesar often violates the rule stated, even when the three substantives are strictly co-ordinate.
[5.] Sontiates; the name (still remaining in the town of Sos) appears to mean ‘ heroes.* (See Gliick, Keltische Namen, p. 155), and is Celtic, not Aquitanian. So the Bituriges of Aquitania were Celts.

1. 31. [5.] aerariae secturae—«copper mines.’ Some MSS. read ‘structurae/ But though the expression ‘subterraneae structurae* occurs in Pliny (36. 22), ‘secturae’ is simpler. The ‘ cuniculi’ were for the purpose of destroying the embankments from beneath.

1. 13. [7.] opinione timoris; see 3. 17, note 7. Here the meaning is * from the idea which they had given our men of their cowardice.' This, however, is an emendation for ‘atque opinione timidiores hostes’ which the MSS. read. If the old reading is retained, the meaning must be * and from their having shown themselves more timid than their reputation.'
1.16. [8.] omnibus cupientibus,1 and finding them all ardent.' So we have the dative * cupientibus signum dat,' as he found them anxious for battle he gave the signal. A similar ellipse of the * verbum sentiendi ’ is found in the form * quum iam non possent,' ‘ as they found themselves now unable.'

So we have the phrases ‘ a fronte,' ‘ ab oriente,' ‘ lex facit a nobis,' ‘ the law is on our side,’ ‘ ab hoste stare,’ ‘ to side with the enemy.’ The gate named is the one to the rear of the camp. On the derivation of the term, see Diet. Antiq. castra, § 6, and Donaldson’s Varronianus, p. 270.

1. 30. [2.] intritae, a participle negatived, like • illaesus.*
1. 33* [3*] prius quam videri posset. It is well to remark a frequent difference between the indicative and conjunctive with ‘ antequam ’ or ‘priusquam.* In 1. 53, Caesar says, ‘neque prius fugere destiterunt, quam ad flumen Rhenum pervenerunt/ Here the indicative throws a narrative stress on * pervenerunt,* making it mean ‘ until they reached the Rhine, as in fact they did reach it.* But • priusquam videri posset ’ means before they could see, without implying that they ever saw. So Sail. Jug. 54 (fin.) * priusquam ex castris subveniretur, in proximos colles discedunt,’ where the help was, in point of fact, not brought See also Kritz, Sail. Catil. 4. ad fin.

1. 27. [3.] ex omnibus partibus silvae evolaverunt; a second Nervian surprise apparently; with the addition of an after loss in the pursuit; and a further failure in all attempts to bring the Morini to bay. This nation was on the sea-shore, as their name shows. * Mor * means * sea ’ in Celtic; and Aremorica the country near the sea (ad mare): so we have the modern Morbihan, ‘the little sea.’ Their seaport was Gessoriacum (Boulogne).
P. 64.1. 1. [o. 29. n. 1.] pro vallo, ‘by way of breastwork,* like the enormous works so often constructed by the Confederates in the American civil war. The meaning can hardly be that Caesar cut down all the woods in order to pursue the Morini. Probably he raised at intervals a breastwork of the kind described.
1. 5. [a.] uti opus necessario intermitteretur, ‘ that the work was necessarily interrupted from time to time.* If Caesar had meant this to mean that the work was broken off for good, he would probably have used the perf. subj., as in 3. 15, ‘singulas (naves) nostri ita expugnaverunt, ut perpaucae ad terram pervenerint.* So ‘contineri non possent* means that ‘it was found day by day impossible to keep the soldiers in tents ’ (pellibus), as canvas was not used by the Romans for this purpose.

BATTLE OF BOMMEL. RHINE BRIDGE. LANDING AT LYMNE.
P. 65.1. I. [o. 1. n. 1.] qui fuit annus, &c., ‘which was the year when Gn. Pompeius and M. Crassus were consuls, A. U. C. 699, B.C. 55. The events of book i. were all in B.C. 58, the Belgian war in 57, the Venetic war in 56. Two members of the triumvirate, Pompeius and Crassus, had made themselves consuls in this year, with a view to wielding the whole powers of the state at home, while theirz6z	notes,	book	iv,	chap.
colleague Caesar managed the most important provinces of the republic.
1. 2. [2.] Usipetes, Tencteri; two German tribes situated on the north bank of the river Lippe, about fifty miles below Cologne. See the map at p. 65.
1. 6. [3.] premebantur; as * complures annos premor * would mean *1 have for many years been pressed* (praeteritum ad praesens, a past time lasting till the present: see 3. 3, note 1); so in this place ‘premebantur * means * they had been hard pressed.*
1. 7. [4.] Suebi, this appears from Mommsen, Hist, of Rome, to be the correct orthography. The name seems etymologically connected with ‘ schweifen/ and tp mean ‘ the rangers, nomads: * not unnaturally, considering their manner of life, as stated in this chapter, and in Tacitus (Germ. 38), who is followed by modem authors. Mommsen, Hist, of Rome, vol. 4. 1, p. 232, states that it denotes a number of nations, and supposes the Chatti to be the one intended here.
1. 8. [5.] centum pagos; the proper meaning of ' pagus ’ in Italy appears to have been ‘a military district round a fortified place.* In other countries it meant one of the larger subdivisions; as in the country of the Helvetii, where there were four (1. 12). Military orders were, therefore, addressed by the commander-in-chief to the various ‘pagi’ (7. 64). But the civil divisions naturally followed the military divisions: so the ‘princeps,* or Landamman (7. 23), elected by the ‘concilium,’ or general assembly of the people (Tacit. Germ. 12), administered justice for his own ‘pagus.’
■1. 10. [6.] qui domi manserunt, * who have in each year remained at home.’
1. 13* [7.] privati agri nihil; the only produce which they extract from the earth is com (Tacit. Germ. 26), and even of this they use very little.
1. 14. [8.] longius anno; this prohibition probably had two objects; first, that the ground might not get too exhausted to bear crops with next to no culture; secondly, that the people might contract no ties with the soil. See Hor. Od. 3. 24, 13, for a poetical view of the arrangement, and infra 6. 23.

1- 3- [I4*] neque haberent. . et lavarentur, &c., ‘on the one hand they wear only skins, and on the other they bathe in the icy streams.* The * haberent * and 4 lavarentur * are, irregularly, in the imperf. subj, much as Cic. Mil. 13 has ‘adepti estis ne quem metueretis.’ In both cases the construction seems to follow the implied idea 4 connisi estis {sunt),* rather than the actual words in which the successful endeavour is expressed. 4 They have habituated themselves to what they wanted, namely, the practice of bathing in the coldest water.’ The reading of MSS. 4 lavantur,’ seems untenable; as 4 lavere ’ is used only by the poets and the very earliest prose writers.
1. 6. [c. 2. n. i.] magis eo . .. quam quo, &e., 4 rather with the view of finding purchasers for their spoil, than because they want any imports/ This is a modification of the more usual phrase, of which Ter. Eun. I. 2, 16 is a good example, * non quo quemquam plus amem, eo feci, sed—/ 41 have ddne this, not because I love any one better, but because—.*
1. 8. [2.] desiderent, simply ‘desire/as in Plin. Hist. Nat. 17. 26, 4 desiderant rigari arbores/
I.9. [3.] impenso pretio, probably literally 4 at a large price;’not 4 having expended a large sum/ Thus we have * impensius damnum/ and even 4 cuius cibo iste factus est impensior/ 4 by whose food that fellow has got fatter/ Plaut. Capt. 4. 3, 26.

1. 11. [0. 7. n. 1.] iter facere coepit; probably by Cambray, Charleroi, Maestricht. Most authors (see Merivale, Rom. Hist. vol. 1, p. 457, with the arguments there urged) are in favour of a different locality for this campaign. The reasons in favour of the view here adopted are given with admirable force and cogency in Jules C£sar, vol. 2, p. 136. They are mainly that the Meuse valley was the recognised entrance into Gaul from Upper Germany, and that from. Coblenz there were no roads practicable for such a migration.
1. 12. [2.] paucorum dierum iter; the Usipetes and Tenchteri had crossed the Rhine near Cleves. As Caesar approached they had fallen back towards the isle of Bommel, between the Meuse and Waal» near their junction*265
1. 15. [3.] recusare quin: generally 4recuso* takes the lighter and more courteous 4 quominus * instead of the simple 4 quin* (ut non). But the idea of refusing to fight does not demand this courteous softening. See i. 4, note 7.
1. 16. [4.] quicumque: understand 4iis* after ‘resistere/ as in Cic. Tusc. v. 7, ‘Xerxes praemium proposuit, qui novam voluptatem invenisset.* This omission is most frequent when the relative and its antecedent would fall into the same case; as in Cic. Phil. 1. 4, 4 Piso parum erat, a quibus debuerat, adjutus.*
1.17. [5.] haec tamen dicere: understand 4dixerunt se/ and note the peremptory tone which Caesar throws into their speech by the omission of conjunctions. See also 1.14, note 7, for the tenses used, and mark the emphasis on 4 neminem * from its position in the sentence, as in 1. 7, 4 propterea quod aliud iter haberent nullum/ and in I. 18, 4 propterea quod illo licente contra liceri audeat nemo.'
1. 23. [c. 8. n. 1.] quae visum est; see 1. 21, 6. Caesar's arguments would have been much the same as those in 1. 14: and he always carefully avoids repetition.

If they had accepted this offer, they would have directed their march by what was afterwards the great Roman road from Leyden to Strasburg and Geneva. See Bertrand* Voies Romaines, p. 37. This road must have existed even at this time. See 6. 9, note 1.

1. 32. [c. 0. n. 1.] post diem tertium, 4 on the next day but one:* hyperbaton (see 4. 28, note 1): as in a.d. iii. kal. oct., 4 ab millibus passuum minus duobus/ In reckoning three days with ‘post* or 4 ante/ the present day and that on which they were to return are each counted as one. The preposition is often thus displaced when the place or time from which the distance is reckoned is not mentioned in the sentence.
P. 69.1. 3. [2.] ad Ambivaritos. These were Belgians on the west of the Meuse, and under Roman protection since the events of book ii.
1. 6. [c. 10. n. 1.] ex monte Vosego; the Meuse really rises from the plateau of Langres, the cradle of French rivers. Vosegus is the Latinised form of the Gallic word 4 fasach/ a mountain waste (like the German 4 Wald ’).
1. 8. [2.] V&c&lus. 4 It then receives the Waal from the Rhine, and thus forms the Batavorum Insula, a triangle bounded by the old Rhine, the Meuse, and the German Ocean. This account is clear enough when the passage is read as in the text; and the geographical difficulties will much diminish if we state briefly what is known about the Delta of theNOTES. BOOK IV, CHAP. II
Rhine. It is plain, in the first place, from geological evidence (Esquiros, The Dutch at Home, p. 8), that the Rhine must have been at some time or other a vast body of water directing itself towards the sea by way of Leyden and what is now the Zuyder Zee, and at times covering with its waters a large part of Utrecht, Overyssel, and Guelderland. Advancing in this direction it would meet the maximum force of the German Ocean (see 5. 7, note 3); which would gradually (as the climate of Europe became milder and the river lost volume) succeed in gaining upon the Rhine and silting up its outlets in this direction. Thus the stream would be driven farther south in search of an issue. In the time of the Roman emperors a balance still seems to have existed between the volume of water conveyed by the northern and southern mouths, the Waal and the Rhine. For we find Civilis, the insurgent Batavian, destroying a dam raised by Drusus near the embranchment of these two rivers. The object of the dam seems to have been to keep the waters from the Waal channel and direct them to the old Rhine; that of Civilis to move the frontier of his country farther soutij by drawing them back to the Waal.
1. ii. [3.] Nantuates, as this nation (supra 3. 1) inhabited French Savoy, it is not easy to see how they can be east of the Furka. Strabo places a nation called the * Actuates ’ in the required position. Perhaps this should be the reading here. Or, as ‘Nant’ means a stream, the name may simply stand for ‘ river-folk.*
[4.] feris nationibus. See Motley, Rise of the Dutch Republic (Introduction), for an admirable account of the ancient Batavians.
1. 18. [o. ll. n. 1.] Caesar cum abesset. The name is placed at the beginning as if it were the nominative to the main verb; then the construction alters.
1. 23. [2.] in Ubios legatos mittendi: from this passage mainly Merivale concludes that the battle with the Usipetes was near Coblenz. He holds it impossible that they could have proposed to send an embassy from Cleves to the neighbourhood of Cologne, so as to return in three days. Yet the difficulty would be hardly less on the other supposition, as the German cavalry would then have had to get from the lower Meuse to Coblenz in the same time. It is possible either that ‘ ad eas res conficiendas * may mean ‘ in order to arrange for the embassy,* or that the ambassadors wildly pressed for these three days without closely considering what they promised to accomplish in them. Or finally, the narrative may be deficient in good faith on Caesar’s part. See theTollowing notes.
1* 27. [3.] eodem pertinere, * tended to the same object.* Note the use of this word in 1.1. ‘ Eodem * is of course an adverb,

P. 70.1. 2. [o. 12. n. 1.] ubi primum.. conspexerunt, * as soon as ever they caught sight of our cavalry/ Note that if the cavalry had gone in advance towards an enemy only twelve miles off, before the ambassadors‘were dismissed with tidings of the truce, it is possible, to say the least, that the German cavalry had not heard of the armistice.

[4.] Piso Aquitanus. From the similar case of C. Valerius Procillus (1. 47) we may conclude that this Gallic chief had received a Roman name along with citizenship: perhaps from the L. Piso mentioned in 1. 12.
*5* [5 ] regnum,4royal power/ as in 1. 3.
1.16. [6.] amicus; see 1. 33, note 7.
1. 22. [o. 18. n. 1.] hoc facto proelio. This skirmish seems to have strongly confirmed Caesar’s impression of the efficiency of the German cavalry. See iv. a. His feeling appears to have been originally inspired by Ariovistus* horsemen (1. 48), whose organization he afterwards imitated in the battle of Pharsalia1. He must have perceived that if the main body of German cavalry now came up, he would soon find his own Gauls, if any further quarrel arose, absolutely useless in the field, and a revolt of the whole country rising in his rear. Thus he resolved to make no enquiry whether the attack was excusable or not; and to consider the truce irrevocably broken.
1. 24. [2.] per dolum atque insidias, a prepositional adverb; as ' per summum dedecus * means 4 most disgracefully/ So 4 ex confesso/ ‘ confessedly / 4 dte integro/ 4 afresh4 ad postremum/ * finally/
1. 26. [3.] summae dementiae esse iudicabat exspectare: a good reason for fighting at once; if the truce was justly broken. In reciting it, Caesar appears to betray the thoughts which really influenced him.
1. 31. [4.] ne quem diem pugnae, &c., ‘so as not to let a day be missed for fighting/ 4 Pugnae * is genitive, as in the ordinary 4 tempus committendi proelii/ Both phrases would mean literally, according to the accurate analysis of the genitive case, 4 a time in relation to fighting.’

P. 71.1. 3. [6.] contra atque esset dictum, * contrary to what they had stated ;* * atque * is the same as ‘ ac ' or 4 quam; * 4 contra quam ipse censuisset/ Cic. Pis. 8.18.
1. 5. [7.] quos •. illos retineri iussit. Kraner thinks that the unusual * illos ’ is inserted in opposition to 4 ipse/ 4 he ordered them to be detained, while he himself. / More probably the second pronoun is introduced to mark the succession of events, as after the abl. absolute in 7, 4,4 Vercingetorix convocatis suis clientibus facile (eos) incendit/

1. 12. [3.] perturbantur oopiasne ducere praestaret; a pregnant construction understanding 4 dubitatione/ just as in the phrase 4 quid istic fiat, non laboro/ 4 sollicitudine * is implied.

1. 20. [5.] ad quos .. equitatum misit. This incredible barbarity, together with the cancelling of the truce, caused Cato’s celebrated outburst in the Roman senate, on the proposal of a 4 supplicatio ' for this victory (Plut. Caes. 22). Caesar, he declared, ought to be delivered up to the Tenchteri, as an expiation for his atrocious perfidy to them.
1. 28. [0. 15. n. 1.] ex tanti belli timore, 4 great though the apprehended scale of the war had been/ The preposition 4ex* is here a substitute for a concessive abl. absolute: just as 4 in tanto imperio populi Romani’ in 1. 33, note 3, is equivalent to a causative. See also
22, note 2.
1. 30. [2.] discedendi potestatem fecit. Caesar's sparing the senate may be held a sufficient proof that he did not really consider them guilty of the charge he makes against them. Compare his different treatment of the Breton senate, whom he did think guilty (3. 16), though he admits that they were so only on compulsion.
1. 31. [3.] supplicia Gallorum veriti. Was the 4 auctoritas apud Gallos/ of chap. 13, consistent with the fact of these ravages, and with the further consequences which Caesar’s defeat would have entailed on the Gauls?
P. 72. 1. 3. [c. 10. n. I.] iustissima causa, ‘the most decisive cause/	#

1. 29. [o. 17. n. 1.] neque suae dignitatis, literally, ‘nor in relation to his dignity/ that is, conformable to it.
1. 30. [2.] summa difficultas faciendi pontis proponebatur,
‘ although the task which was before him of making a bridge was a very difficult one.' For the hypallage compare 3. 8, note 2, where in much the same way an adjective idea is expressed substantively; 4 magnus impetus maris atque apertus,' meaning * an open and very impetuous sea.'
1. 32. [3.] contendendum; see 1. 31, note 2.
1. 33. [4.] rationem pontis hanc instituit,4 the plan of the bridge which he adopted was as follows.'
P.73.1.1. [5.] tigna bina, ‘he coupled piles together in pairs.' Two such piles solidly fastened together by struts would have the same resisting power as if a solid beam filled up the whole two feet of interval between them; but, from this latter space being open, the resistance to the water would be much less.
1. 3. [6.] iungebat, * he joined in successive pairs/ whence the imperfect.
1. 3. [7.] machinationibus, * by means of guides.*
1. 5. [8.] prone ao fastigate; with a slope like that of the roof of a house. That is, every upward double pile was sunk at a distance of forty feet from its corresponding one below. Both double piles were inclined, the upper one down the stream, the lower one up it; so that their heads were about twenty-six feet from one another.
1. 9. [9.] bipedalibus trabibus, * two-foot beams (to support the road-way) were then let in so as to rest upon the strut between the heads of the double pile.' The end of these exactly filled the interval between the two members of each pile.
[10.] binis flbulis, ‘by pairs of braces.* The brace was a length of rough firwood passing from the head of each pile to the middle point of the next pile up or down stream.

would stand either pressure» if two of the piles tended to approach one another, or strain, if they tended to separate.
[12.] ea rerum natura, ‘and such was the character of the whole arrangement, that a pressure at any given point would be borne by the upper and lower piles; the one resisting the pull, the other the push.*
[13.] direota materia, ‘ with joists laid lengthways; * that is, at right angles to them. See Jules C£sar (vol. 3, p. 260).
[14.] nihilo Becius; although the framework was strong enough independently, yet it was further supported by slanting shores below, which were at one end made fast to the timbers of the bridge and at the other sunk in the river-bed.
[15.] aliae supra; others by way of stockades a little above.
1. ao. [16.] deioiendi operis, ‘in relation to (that is, ‘ for the purpose of’) throwing down the work.*
1. 2i. [17.] earum rerum; see 1. 4,1; ‘defensoribus’ is the same as ‘defendentibus;* ‘neu* the same as ‘et ne,’ as in 2. 21, ‘cohortatus est, ut memoriam pristinae virtutis retinerent, neu perturbarentur animo.’
1. 22. [o. 18. n. 1.] diebus deeem, quibus. Literally ‘within ten days within which,* that is, ‘ from the time when.* So Cic. Rose. Amer. 37, ‘ quatriduo quo occisus est,’ • within four days from the time when he was slain.’ Ter. Andr. 1.1, 77, ‘in paucis diebus quibus haec acta sunt.’ See 3. 23,1.
1. 23. [2.] exercitus traducitur; observe that, in resuming the history after the description of the bridge, the historic present is used. The country of the Sicambri was near Cassel.
P. 74.1. 4. [o. 10. n. 1.] nuntios dimisisse uti, &c., 'had sent messengers to tell them to leave their homes.*
1. 6. [2.] atque omnes, we should expect • utque.* Probably ' omnes qui arma ferre possent’ is rather a limitation of the nominative ‘ they,* than itself the nominative.
1. 8. [3.] hio . . . atque ibi; unusual as expressing the same place. Probably Caesar's thought was ‘ ibidem.’
[4.] ut Germanis metum iniceret, namely, ‘ that he might terrify the Germans.* The anaphora, or repetition, of ‘ ut ’ helps the idea of enumeration.
L 15. [5.] pontemque rescidit. Those who consider the battle with the Tenchteri to have been! near Coblentz, naturally fix the locality for this passage on the flat ground near Andemach. If the battle, on the other hand, was near the isle of Bommel, a more northward point would suit this passage better. Caesar’s object being to relieve the Ubii from the pressure of the Suevi, and also to punish the Sicambri, it would seem natural that he should cross the Rhine so as just to enter the Ubian territory, and then make this his base of operations against the Sicambri.271
IT so, a reference to the map will show that the passage must have been near Cologne or Bonn. Of these the latter is probably the real spot; as we may see by a comparison of the itinerary in 6. 29 foil., with the present passage. On the character of the bridge, see Merivale, yoL i, p. 461, note; on the difficulty of constructing it by the labour of mere legionaries, Hyde’s Fortification, § 234.
[o. 20. n. 1.] exigua parte reliqua, • although only a small part of the summer still remained.* See 1. 33, note 4.
[3.] ad septentriones vergit. The meaning seems to be the same as in i. 16, ‘ Gallia sub septentrionibus posita est,* * lies in a high latitude.*
[3.] proficisci contendit, &c., ‘arranged to go into Britain.* Compare the sense of the words here with that of those in 1. 23, 1. 53, 3- 3-
1. 23. [4.] Gallis erant incognita: the chief trade with Britain was in the hands of the Veneti; and they, according to Strabo (4. 271), were anxious to thwart the expedition. Hence probably an assumed ignorance.
1. 29. [5.] quem usum belli, * what degree of practice in war.*
1. 32. [c. 21. n. 1.] periculum facere, ‘ to make a trial.’ This sense results literally from the derivation. Compare the sense of  peritus.*
F. 75.1. 2. [2.] in Morinos; this nation extends as far up as the Scheldt; but the ‘ brevissimus traiectus * indicates that Caesar chose the Strait of Dover for this passage. As to the port, all later authorities are agreed that it could only have been Gessoriacum (Boulogne). For this port was universally used for embarkations to Britain under the emperors; it is the only one which has subsidiary ports at the distances mentioned by Caesar; it was the harbour to which the military roads led (see Bertrand, Voies Romaines, pp. 5, 6); and, finally, it is the only port anywhere near the Strait of Dover which could hold fleets of anything like the size which Caesar collected there K See the map at P- 75.
1. 8. [3.] polliceantur obsides dare: the future inf. is used in the next chapter with ‘polliceor.* Euphony would be against it in this passage. For the verb, see I. 42, note 3, which justifies the tense here used; as ‘ pollicer * originally means 4 to put forward.*
[4.] Atrebatibus superatis; in the battle on the Sambre (2. 23). The same nation occupied Berkshire; whence the supposed influence of Commius in Britain.
1. 15. [5.] fidem sequantur,4 to submit to the allegiance.*

‘ ora fuere mihi plus ave docta loqui/
1. 31. [4.] coactis contractisque, 'having been collected and mustered.’ The reading ‘ constratis/ ‘ decked vessels,’ would make it appear that the troops were not embarked on the ' onerariae/ But it is evident that they were so embarked, at the rate of 100 men per vessel. Each of the eighteen remaining ships would carry twenty-five horses, the cavalry would be therefore 450 in number.
F. 76.1. a. [5.] ab milibus passuum octo, ‘ in the port of Amble- teuse, where they had been windbound (naturally, as the position of the two ports shows) by the same breeze which was favourable for Caesar’s transit.
1. 10. [o. 23. n. I.] tertia vigilia, ‘at midnight/ and on the 26th of August, B.C, 55. For the full moon occurred (c. 29) four days after ; and all astronomers are agreed that the moon was full on the night of Aug. 30 (accurately at 3 a.m. on the 31st). Tide-tables show that on that day it was high water at Boulogne at about 7.25 p.m., for the tide is forty-eight minutes later than the corresponding tide on the previous day: and it was high water at Boulogne at 11.25 P-m- on the 3Ist» the day of the full moon. Thus the end of the flood and the beginning of the ebb were.occupied by Caesar’s fleet in dropping down the harbour; and the fleet was ready to sail by midnight
[2.] hora quarta: he reached the Dover shore at about 8.30 (the first hour at this season was at 5.6), and then rode at anchor, for his transports to come up, till about 3.30. There had been high water at Dover on that day at 7.36 a.m.; for it was high tide at Boulogne at 7.49, and Dover tides are thirteen minutes in advance of those of Boulogne.
1. 21. [3.] ut rei militaris ratio, &c., * as, he said, all military practice, especially that on board ship, required.* The subjunctive being the quasi-oblique seems to induce Caesar to put ‘ut* instead of ‘quod,* which would be more natural.
1. 24. [4.] ventum et aestum secundum. The tidal current off Dover turns from east to west four hours after high water, and then runs west for seven hours. Therefore as high water had been at 7.36 a.m. on that day, the current had turned at 11.36, and had to run west, in the direction of Romney, till 6.36 p.m..NOTES. BOOK IV, CHAP. 24-28*
1. 26. [5.] circitor milia septem. If there is no error in Mr. Lewin’s calculations (which have been followed throughout the preceding notes), Caesar now lands at a point about seven Roman miles west of Dover, that is, at Lymne m Romney marsh, where, at a distance of about two miles from the present beach, may be seen the old line of cliffs and the ruins of the Roman port. Mr. Lewin’s work gives some interesting mediaeval maps, showing the stale of Lymne at different times.

1. 25. [c. 28. n. 1.] post diem quartum; as the date of Aug. 27th assumed above for Caesar’s landing depends on these words, it is necessary to be sure of their meaning. This is exactly parallel with that of' ante diem quartum/ which is well known to mean ‘ three days before/ a phrase so completely established, that Latin writers (e g. Cic. Phil. 3. 8) use the three words as if they were one substantive,- ‘ in a. d iv. Kal. Dec. distulit/ The parallelism may be proved by Cic. de Div. 1. 25, where ‘post diem tertium’ is a rendering of Plato’s rj^an rpirary (Crit. 43 D), which from the context in Plato necessarily means ‘ the day after to-morrow/ as Socrates is arguing that the Theorie vessel will arrive only on the morrow, and therefore he will have to die only on the following day. So above in 4. 9, the same expression is used for

1. 30. [2.] cursum tenere posset. If ‘ut’ had here governed the perfect subj. (as in 3. 15, ‘ut perpaucae ad terram pervenerint*) the narrative stress on the sequence would have been stronger. The imperfect lays more stress on the strength of the cause.
1. 33. [3.] quae tamen. The conciseness of this sentence is remarkable. The implied meaning is, * yet they were not lost after all. But finding that they should be swamped at anchor, they were obliged to run out to sea right into the darkness: and so they reached the main land.*
P. 70.1. 1. [4.] adversa nocte. Lit. 'with night facing them.*

1. 23. [3.] incertis ordinibus, ‘ since the ranks could not be regularly formed.*
1. 25. [o. 33. n. 1.] ex essedis pugnae: it will be observed that there is no mention in Caesar of the scythes with which the British chariots are traditionally thought to have been armed, and of which Xenophon speaks so contemptuously (Anab. 1. 8, 20). The chariots of the Britons were large, and contained six men each; so that they were really a compendious kind of cavalry (‘ covinarius eques,* as Tacitus calls them inNOTES. BOOK IV, CHAP. 34-37.
Agric. 35), requiring only two horses for six riders, and with a special facility for dismounted duty. Their being driven along forest paths makes it highly improbable that they can have been scythed. The name seems to be derived from 4 esedha * or * assedha,’ Celtic forms of • sedeo.*
1. 3a. [a.] stabilitatem peditum. Caesar appears always to have been much struck by these mixed cavalry and infantry organizations. See 4. 13, note 1.

1. 32. [o. 86. n. 1.] die aequinoctii; Sept. 24th. Caesar had therefore been nearly a month in Britain without being able to advance a mile from the shore.
P. 82.1. 4. [2.] paulo infra delatae sunt; probably, as Mr. Lewin remarks, from a cause which has destroyed many vessels at this point; from their pilots not being aware, that is, that the west current sets in on the French coast while that to the east is still running in midchannel. They may have been carried to Etaples.
1. 6. [0. 87. n. 1.] Morini; as the soldiers from these two vessels were attacked by the Morini, this point alone may be considered to refute the theory of an eminent astronomer, that Caesar sailed from St. Valery and landed near Pevensey. For if these men had been carried down west of the Somme, they would have landed in the territory of the Ambiani, not in that of the Morini, i 15. [2.] paucis vulneribus; ‘with slight losses,’
T 2. NOTES. BOOK IV, CHAP. 38.
1. 2T. [c. 38. n. 1.] siccitates paludum; this throws a curious doubt on Caesar’s statement about the weather in chap. 34. A mere series of gales would not have made military operations impossible: and this passage looks as if there could not have been much rain.
1. 30. [2.] dierum viginti supplicatio; even fifteen days had been unprecedented till the defeat of the Belgae in book ii. The present thanks were for small mercies. See Liv. Epit. lib. 105, * in Britanniam primo parum prospere traiecit.' Dion Cass. 4. I, tuuccvrp t6t€ dye-

1. 6. [3.] Dumnorix, brother of the Druid Divitiacus, who had been under surveillance ever since the Helvetian campaign (1. 20. fin.). His name,4 domun-rig/ means, modestly,4 king of the world/
1. 20. [4.] fieri' ut spoliaretur means rather more than ‘spoliari* alone; something of the nature of a general result So 4 factum est ut * means ‘the combined circumstances had this resuit/ ‘credebant fore ut/ 4 they thought that things would so turn out that.* See 1. 10, note 2.

1. 33. [3.] magnam partem omnis temporis, of the whole year. Accordingly, when hydraulic windmills came into use in Holland, as they could not be turned to the varying winds, they were built so that the plane of the sails faced the north-west. (Esquiros, The Dutch at Home, p. 35.)

1. 9. [2.] molli atque aperto, * shingly and clear of rocks.*
[3.] equitatu: see 1. 8, note 1.
[4.] ad flumen. This would be the Stour, near Wye. The Britons, feeling themselves unable to oppose the debarkation of such a force as Caesar’s, fell back towards Canterbury (which was even then the capital of Kent). They displayed considerable generalship in occupying, at this point, the defile through which the Ashford and Canterbury railway is now carried; keeping at the same time on the north bank of the Stour, so that Caesar, who could not leave the enemy on his line of communication, must necessarily cross the river to attack them.
I.13- [5*] ex loco superiore; ‘ occupied the north bank, which was higher than the south one; and so endeavoured to keep off our men, and even engaged hand to hand.’ As in 3. 2, note 4, the words * ex loco superiore * are not strictly governed by ‘ prohibere.’NOTES. BOOK V, CHAP. 10-12;

1. 20. [7.] testudine facta; the legions had now work in which they were quite at home. Locking their shields, so as to form a roof over their heads; and thus bringing up earth enough to form an embankment, they soon stormed the work. The seventh legion was the one which had been so roughly handled in the last year’s campaign.

1. 6. [o. 11. n. 1.] fabros; as the engineer corps in the Roman army seems to have been separate from the legions (Orelli, Inscr. 2, p. 96), it is probable that volunteers who happened to understand carpenter’s work were here called for.
1. 8. [2.] iis legionibus; see 1. 8, note 1.
[3.] Cassivellauno. The presence of such an enemy as Caesar made them forget their civil broils, and for the time Caswallon (first of the roll of English heroes) was accepted as general even by his bitterest enemies, the Trinobantes.
1. 20. [4.] a mari milia passuum LXXX, that is, eighty miles from the sea at Romney.
1. 25. [0. 12. n. 1.] Britanniae pars interior. Caesar’s object in writing these details about Britain is indicated by the curiosity which enlightened men at Rome felt about the island. Thus Cicero writes to his brother Quintus, who commanded one of Caesar’s legions, * modo mihi date Britanniam quam pingam coloribus tuis penicillo meo. . • Quos tu situs, quas naturas rerum et locorum, quos mores, quas gentes, quas pugnas habes’ (Ad Quint. 2.15, 16). Compare for the similarly enlightened curiosity about America at the time of its discovery, Prescott, Ferd. and Isabella, vol. 2, p. 106.
1. 25. [2.] natos in insula, rather the earliest Celtic immigrants. The existence of an earlier Iberian population is certain, on grounds of comparative anatomy: but Celtic names occupy even the western parts of England, where the Iberian population has lasted longest.
1. 27. [3.] ex Belgio. The identical names alluded to by Caesar are the Atrebates, Belgae (and Parisii). See Latham, Ethn. of the British Islands, p. 70. There were no Cantii, Trinobantes, nor Regni in Gaul; but the names of towns on the two sides of the channel are so similar, that Caesar is probably accurate in stating that the origin of these tribes was Belgian.
1. 30. [4.] hominum,1 of the population.*
F. 90. 1. 1. [5.] plumbum album, * tin.* It seems obvious that Caesar must have meant the tin mines to be on the coast, the iron works in the central districts.28a	NOTES,	Book	V,	CHAP. 13, 14.
I. 2. [6.] aere importato; probably from the ancient copper mines in Dalecarlia. Those in England were not worked with any spirit till the eighteenth century.
I. 4. [7.] leporem, gallinam, anserem. The hare, as is well known, was forbidden by the Mosaic law; nor is there any mention in the Bible of chickens and geese as articles of food. Hare appears to have been considered unhealthy in various ways: geese and chickens probably required more corn-feeding than they would get in Britain to make them palatable.
1. 5. [8.] animi causa; so Penelope in Od. T9. 537 says of her geese, Ha i T€ a<pi v law open daopouxra.

1. 12. [c. 13. n. 1.] vergit ad Hispaniam, ‘looks out towards Spain/ Tacit. (Agric. 34) actually says that Ireland is between Britain and Spain.
[2.] pari atque, like ‘eodem atque/
[3.] Mona, called by Ptolemy Monoeda or Moneitha, by Bede Monavia. The latter form seems to connect ft with Menevia (St. David’s); the former with the Celtic * menedh/ a mountain (properly ‘ a mass’), whence it can mean a mountain, an island, or a headland.
1. 19, [4.] nisi certis ex aqua mensuris, ‘except that (nisi quod) by accurate clepsydra measures/ From Caesar’s interest m such things he would probably have used the clepsydra of Ctesibius, in which water was made to drop upon wheels, which were thereby turned. See Diet, of Antiq , art. Horologium.

1. 3r. [2.] vitro inficiunt, whence Ovid calls us the ‘virides Britanni/ They were tattooed with ‘variae animalium effigies/ Can it be that the civilised Belgians adopted this custom from their barbarian neighbours (as hunters in the far west sometimes follow the fashions of ther Indians) ? Herodian states that our habit of not wearing clothes was adopted in order not to conceal the fine works of art on our skins.
1. 34. [3.] uxores communes: it is hard of course to refute this outrageous charge. But inasmuch as the accounts of modem travellers do not state anything equally vile of the most barbarous tribes now known, it seems reasonable to doubt it. Sir J. Lubbock (PrehistorictfOTES. BOOK V, CHAP. 1$,	281
Man, p. 388) tells us, it is true, of a somewhat similar arrangement among the Tahitians. ‘A considerable number,’ he says, ‘of the principal people were formed into an association called the “ Arreoy,” all the' members of which were regarded as being married to one another. If any of the women of the society had a child, it was almost invariably killed; if it was allowed to live, the father and mother were regarded as having definitively engaged themselves to one another, and were ejected from the association; the woman being henceforth known as a “bearer of children;” which was among this extraordinary people a term of reproach.’ This practice, then, was evidently intended to repress, from natural causes, the birth of children. Can it be possible that, if a custom at all like it had been extensively prevalent in Britain, there would have been in the island the * infinita multitudo hominum * which Caesar describes. See, for the arguments on the other side, the Piet, llist. of England (i. 192), and in confirmation of those here adduced, 5. 54, 8, and the * Fortnightly Review,’ Nos. XX, XXII, on the' whole subject of Briton barbarism *.

[4.] per medios perruperunt, * they dashed at the interval; * probably sweeping away the flank companies of each cohort. These are thought to have been in Caesar’s time fuller than the other cohorts, and at a later period were called ‘ cohortes milliariae,’ and had a double number of men. Their dignity consisted also partly in having the custody of the eagle. Diet. Antiq. p. 500 a.

1. 6. [3.] neque finem sequendi fecerunt. After repelling the enemy’s charge, the legion advanced steadily in pursuit; until at length the cavalry, finding that they would be supported, dashed forward in advance and drove the enemy before them.
[4.] auxilia: the various contingents of British troops left Cas- wallon’s army. Quintus Cicero appears to have written about this time to his brother in a tone of qualified confidence; for the orator answers 4 cognovi nihil esse nec quod metuamus, nec quod gaudeamus * ♦ (Ad Q. Fr. 3.1).
[c. 18. n. 1.] uno omnino loco; Conway, Sunbury, Petersham, Kingston, Wallingford, and even Westminster, claim the honour of Caesar’s transit. The evidence is slight upon the point; except indeed that the distance of eighty miles from the landing-place indicates a point some distance up the Thames. All we can say is, that the passage was probably above Teddington, where the river ceases to be tidal; probably not far above it, for Caesar was not likely, with the country about St. Alban’s for his object, to go up higher than he needed. He had probably crossed the Medway at Aylesford, near Maidstone, and the South Downs somewhere near Reigate; and so marched across by way of the present Ewell to Kingston-on-Thames. See the map at 4. 20.
1. 22. [2.] cum capite solo exstarent; see 1. 41, note 7. A ford must now not be reported practicable for infantry, says Hyde (Fortif. p. 180), if it is more than a yard deep. This shows us the value of the legionary training which enabled the men to manage such difficulties.

[2.] mittat qui obtineat; the context shows that they wished for Mandubracius. It is needless to point out how fatal this secession was to the British cause.283
[c. 21. n. 1.] Cenimagni, in Bedford and Cambridge; Cassi, in Hertfordshire; Segontiaci, apparently near Silchester; Ancalites, on the Thames, near Henley; Bibroci, uncertain.
Lai. [2.] oppidum Cassivellauni, thought, on slight evidence, to be St. Alban’s. As to Caesar’s explanation of * oppidum,’ it may be remembered that in many provincial dialects the word * town ’ even now means simply an enclosure, farmyard, or the like. The corresponding British word was probably ‘ dun ’ (Prichard, Hist, of Mankind, vol. 3, p. 126), as in modem Welsh 4din as' means either a castle or a city. The Romans called it4 dunum.*

I. 32,4 dicendi mora dies extrahentur.* A special cause of disturbance was now agitating Caesar. He had just heard of the death of his daughter, Julia, the wife of his colleague Pompeius. Thus almost the only remaining bar against civil war was removed. See Lucan 1.115.
[2.] vectigalis; no garrison was left behind, and therefore no tribute ever paid. Cicero also expresses disappointment at the fact that no gold was found in Britain, and only the rudest kind of slaves (ad. Att. 4. 16). As to the desolation which Caesar left behind him in Britain, we have an indirect evidence in Dion (41. 30), who represents Caesar as saying, ‘Who would not grieve if he saw Italy laid as thoroughly waste as Britain?* See 5. 48, note 4.
1. 19. [c. 23. n. 1.] duobus commeatibus, 4 by two relays: * lit.4 two goings backwards and forwards.* From this original meaning sprang also the two senses of • provision * and 4 furlough.’

I.4. [3.] Quinto Ciceroni; this officer had commanded a legion through the second British campaign; Caesar having appointed him in order to win his eminent brother to his cause; or, rather, as Mommsen suggests, by way of guarantee that neither of the brothers should plot against him.
1. 5. [4.] Esubios, in west Normandy, near Seez.
1. 5. [5.] in Bemis ; the principle of the arrangement of these troops is easily discernible. Durocortum or Rheims was their central point.NOTES. BOOK V, CHAT. 25-27;
(See the maps at pp. 35 and 65.) The legion there was supported ’in the rear by the three at Amiens (Samarobriva), and elsewhere. Labienus' was out in the Ardennes direction, Cicero pushed forward to the Sambre, near Waterloo, and Sabinus and Cotta still farther, probably to Tongres, in the Meuse valley. These latter divisions lay along what was afterwards, and probably then, the great line of road from Rheims, by Gem- blonx, Tongres, and Juliers, to the Rhine at Cologne. For the quarters of Cotta, Sabinus, and Cicero, see the notes on 6. 32, and the map at 4. 1.

This unmeasured rating of those who had died in his service does not say much for Caesar’s probable popularity among his officers. Appendix D. to Jules C£sar, vol. 2, shows how many of his early ‘legati’ deserted him. Especially astonishing is the bitter enmity of Labienus (Bell. Civ. 3.19, 71)-

In Greek the concealed predicate would be indicated by the article following, wt hrjB*v ovte far* ix^pov rod KAiowot irapaivovfiivojv roxnojv. For want of the article this construction is less frequent in Latin.

P. 101. 1. 2. [9.] Gn. Pompeius. Foreigners obtaining the ' civitas' often adopted the ‘nomen' and ‘praenomen' of the Roman noble through whom they gained it. Thus we have C. Valer. Procillus in 1. 19, M. Calp. Piso in 4.12.
1. 4. [o. 86. n. 1.] sperare impetrari posse; the three infinitives are so arranged as not to produce any obscurity.
L 6. [2.] nocitum iri, literally, ‘ that it was not being gone to hurt him.* How strangely clumsy this periphrasis seems as compared with the simple 0\a&ri<r«a$ai which a Greek would use. This alone would show which is the older language.

1. 25. [3.] se ipsi interficiunt. Compare Lucan's striking description of a similar scene at sea (Phare. 4. 520). We learn from Suetonius (Vita Jul. Caes. 67), that on hearing of this disaster Caesar vowed to let his beard and hair grow till he had taken vengeance on the Eburones; but the end of chap. 52 throws some doubt on the truth of this story.
L 33. [0. 88.] Nervios; it has been already remarked (2. 28, note)NOTES. BOOK V, CHAP. 39-42,
that the destruction of the Nervii as described in that chapter must be exaggerated.. Here we find them with an independent force of their own; and also retaining the command of a confederacy. So in 7. 75, they send 5,000 men to Alesia. See, however, the footnote to 2. 28.

1. 23. [c. 40. n. I ] turres admodum centum et viginti, &cM * about 120 towers were raised.’ If we estimate the circumference of the camp of a legion at 4,600 feet, then 120 towers would give a distance of about 40 feet from tower to tower. Every point of the curtain between the towers would thus be well within the reach of missiles from towers on each side of it, and therefore there would be no need to expose the men on the wall. They were open at the sides and behind, solidly timbered towards the enemy, and their object was, like that of modern bastions, to shorten the length of wall to be occupied by the defence. See plate 27 to vol. 2 of Jules C6sar. The difficulty of the defence on the preceding day from the simple banquette must have been extreme.
I. 31. [2.] praeustae sudes ; the stores of regular missiles must have been soon expended in such a continued conflict.

1. 29. [2.] faloes, for pulling down a turf wall; testudines, wooden galleries under which to approach and undermine the wall. For ‘ milium passuum * it would seem that • pedum ’ should be read. There would be no object in a circumvallation of fifteen miles.

1« 10.

[8.] qui virtute belli omnibus gentibus praeferebantur. The terror which the name of Gaul inspired at Rome has been already noticed (2. 35, note 4); and how roughly the British Celts had handled Caesar we may judge from the fact that in starting on this campaign Caesar's two legions which had just returned from Britain contained together only 7000 men (chap. 49). When, therefore, Dr. Prichard says (Hist, of Mankind, vol. 3, p. 179) that the Celtic nations were always defeated when they came into collision with the Germans, and when this fact is treated as a corroboration of the accounts of their immorality, we ought to enquire whether Roman protectorates rather than national customs did not enfeeble the Gauls and make them incapable of resistance. Such is Tacitus' view (Agric. u).

It should be remarked that the inducement to place this passage of the Rhine near Coblenz is the assumption that the Treveri did not come down so low as Bonn. But there is nothing to fix their north boundary; that it was the Ahr is a mere hypothesis, and fixing the passage at Coblenz would imply some unintellig.ble countermarching.

It is true, however, that this range makes a great barrier between the nations north and south of it. Its difficulties hindered the junction of the Bavarians with the Hanoverians just before the battle of Langensalza: see Hozier, The Seven Weeks* War, vol. ii.
1. 34. [o. II. n. 1.] quoniam ad huno locum perventum est; as the military operations to be recounted have no marked character.
1. 28. [2.] pagis partibusque, * in all cantons and sections of cantons.*
1. 29. [3 ] factiones sunt, so Tacitus says of Britain (Agric. 12), * Olim regibus parebant, nunc per principes factionibus et studiis trahuntur,* and he adds, ‘ nec aliud pro nobis utilius.* Caesar manifestly considers that this institution of patronage was older than the democratic constitutions in Gaul (1. 3, note 6). Exactly in the same way we find it existing under the oligarchic constitution at Athens: but the OT&trcis gained infinitely more power when democracies were established (see Arnold, Thucyd. vol. 1. App. 1).
1. 31. [4.] quorum ad arbitrium summa rerum redeat. This cannot mean that the chiefs of the factions are the leaders most esteemed by the governments of the various states: for we have seen in 1.2, note 1, and 1. 17, note 1, that the greatest dangers to the established governments arose from them. The sense must probably be that the chiefs are selected by the men of influence, those who can carry the rest of the party with them.
1. 32. [5.] eius rei oausa, * because of the existence of these factions.’
1. 32. [6.] antiquitus institutum. The aneimt institution of client- ship would doubtless have been that of the Scottish clan or Irish sept, in which, as Spenser expresses it, the chieftain was * spent and defended * by his clansmen, and also bound to avenge any injury done to any of them (as, e g., by challenging a neighbour for wronging his blacksmith). This has to be distinguished from two kinds of dientship existing under the republican governments; first the voluntary gathering round a rich man like Orgetorix, and secondly the voluntary combinations formed in the towns against the nobles who wished to reduce them to their old dependence (Thierry, book 4, c. 1).

[6.] quos quod adaequare intellegebatur, ‘and as it was understood that they balanced (the Aedui) in influence with Caesar/ It is unusual (except in the perfect tense) to have this impersonal construction with ‘intelligor/ Caesar apparently wishes to avoid the sound of ‘ qui * with ‘ ii * following and referring to a different subject. ‘Adaequo' is used absolutely, as in Cic.

F. 120.1. 1. [3.] nullo consilio. This must apparently be dative (like ‘ alterae' in 5. 27), as Caesar uses with ‘ adhibeo' only the regular constructions. It should be remarked that * alterius/ * nullius' are the older forms: and if Caesar wrote the above words he must have been touched with the mania for making language uniform which made Cato the censor use such words as ‘sacrem, isti modi/ and even ‘ fitur, flebantur/
1. 7* [4*] religiones, all omens and the like.

1. x3* [4-] multa .. disputant, ‘ they also theorise largely.'
[5.] mundi ac terrarum, • of the universe and the globe/ The process by which ‘mundus* came to have this meaning is curious. Originally it signified an order or outfit; thus ‘mundus muliebris’ stands for a lady’s toilet requisites in the discussions on the Oppian law (Livy 34, 7), and ' habere in mundo ’ means * to have in stock ’ in old writers.NOTES. BOOK VI, CHAP. 15-17.	299
It therefore comes to mean the ordered universe, just as k6<tj.tot does in Greek.

1. 25. [o. 16. n. 1.] pro victimis, ‘by way of victims.* It will be observed that no instances of this kind of sacrifice are given either by Caesar or any other author as occurring in connection with the battles of the period; and considering how carefully Caesar notes such institutions as that of the ‘soldurii’ (3. 22), it may appear that Thierry (4. 1) is right in considering that these horrors were bygone in Caesar’s time. The Romans themselves, it will be remembered, buried two Gauls alive in the forum during the second Punic war, in order to avert an omen (Livy 22. 57), and that not for the first time, as the passage shows. So did the Persians while invading Greece (Herod.
7. 114).
1. 30. [2.] simulacra habent; there is a curious vagueness about this expression. It would seem to mean that the images were of a kind to be kept among them, and not, as the general tone would imply, wicker cages made for the occasion, with some resemblance to the shape of a man. So in the words * quibus succensis ’ there is additional obscurity of conception. The firing of mere wickerwork would hardly produce a sufficient flame; on the other hand, if the image was placed on a pile of wood, as M. Thierry supposes, wickerwork would not be the most natural material for it. This looseness of expression throws a degree of suspicion, if not on the existence of the custom, yet on the fact that it was current in Caesar's time.
P. 122.1. 3. [3.] descendunt, * they have recourse.* So we have in 5. 48, ‘ redire,* * to be reduced,’ and 4 deiectus,’4 disappointed.*
I.4. [o. 17. n. 1.] Mercurium; see Tacit. Germ. 9. The general sense which we get from this passage is that the Gauls worshipped gods whose attributes and cultus were like those of certain Roman300	NOTES.	BOOK	VI,	CHAP.	18, 19.
divinities. Thus Jupiter is probably Taranis, the god of thunder, for ‘taran* is Celtic for thunder. Mercury is Teutates (Luw Taith, the god of travelling'): and this name closely resembles the name of Thoth, by which the same divinity, the author of all arts, was known in the East (Plato, Phaedr. § 274). The god whom Caesar calls Mars was Hesus. A figure of him and one probably of Taranis are given from antique sources in the Piet. Hist, of England, vol. 1, p. 68. See also the passage of Lucan quoted at 6. 13.
1. 8. [2.] Apollinem, that is, the Gallic god Belenis. Here we seem to trace a strong resemblance between the two names, especially if the old form Apello (Apellen) be taken. Bika was also the Spartan name for the Sun, and d&ikiot is a form of fjktot.
1. 10. [3.] Minervam operum initia tradere : as Minerva was not a Grecian but an Etruscan and Roman goddess, her worship in Gaul may have been of the same character as in those countries. She is, as her name shows (* menervo’ being an old form of * moneo*), the sug- gester of all ideas, as Teutates or Mercury developes ideas into arts. It is evident that the Gallic idea was to worship both the outward power of nature and the inward ones of the mind, divine and human.
1. 14. [4.] reliquas res, * the remainder of the spoil.*
1. 20. [o. 18. n. 1.] ab Dite prognatos, * sprung from the realms of night: * that is, apparently,4 aboriginal on their own soil.*

1. 31. [2.] fruotus servantur: this kind of settlement on the survivor must have involved some self-denial and saving power, and it implies a position of authority and dignity for wives. By Roman law in just the same way the 4 dos * contributed by the wife was often met by a 4 donatio propter nuptias*8 on the husband’s part.
1. 31. [3,] uter vita superavit; whichever of the two outlives the other receives both 4 dos ’ and 4 donatio ; * with the interest which has accrued from each during the time of the marriage.

1. 21. [3.] eos solos quos cernunt. Caesar’s limited knowledge of Germany made him acquainted only with the three German deities here mentioned, the sun, the moon, and Vulcan; by which last is to be understood, apparently, the clear sky (Wolken, welkin). To these Tacitus (Germ. 40) adds another of the same character, the earth- goddess worshipped with awful rites in a Baltic island, and above all a ‘ regnator omnium Deus' (39,) who may have been the Tuis Tuisco or Zcvtof his second chapter; and a 'deus Mercurius’ (9), supposed on good grounds to be Odin or Woden. Carlyle (Heroes, sect. 1) explains this identity fully.

[o. 23. n. 1.] finitimos cedere, in objective propositions, Caesar’s preference for the weak accusative and infinitive is marked. Cicero prefers the strong subjunctive form, 4 proprium est epistolae, ut is ad quem scribitur, de his rebus, quas ignoret, certior fiat ’ (de Orat. 3. 112).

P. 125. 1. 1. [c. 24. n. 1.] cum Germanos Galli superarent. Caesar concludes that as there are Volcae Tectosages in Bavaria, they must have sprung from a Gallic colony emigrating eastward. Rather they were a section of the nation which never penetrated so far west as Gaul, but stayed behind just as other sections did in Bohemia, Moravia, &c.

The reasons for doing so are given at length in Jules Clsar (vol. a, p. 201, note), ard are in substance that no other place satisfies the necessary conditions. The two principal objections would be that Tongres was by no means in the centre of the Eburonian territory, and that Caesar makes no mention of crossing the Meuse on this march. But the ford of Vis4 was probably well known even then; so that the passage of the Meuse would not call for any peculiar notice; and a military man would take his idea of a central position more from the roads than from the general country which he occupies. Thus Tongres would be a * medius locus,' as lying on the great arterial road of the Meuse, by which alone the baggage of the army could be transported. Note that Aduatuca must not be confounded with the Aduatum of a. 29, note I, which is the citadel of Namur.

Trebonius, by keeping his moveable column in Cicero’s neighbourhood, would strengthen Caesar’s point dappui, and keep the communication with Rheims open. Labienus, meanwhile, was to drive the enemy up towards the isle of Bommel. Caesar, with the three remaining legions, went towards Brussels and Antwerp.

This harping on 4 fortuna * ever since the British expedition betrays a kind of wavering in Caesar’s fatalist views and trust in himself. He trusted his ‘felicitas’ in 1. 40, 2. 38, tries to persuade himself that it still exists (though appearances are against it) in 4. 26, 5. 23, half admits that it is against him in 6. 30, and finally, in 6. 42, finds a balance in his favour.

1. 18. [o. 39. n. 1.] praecurrunt equites, the cavalry which had joined the foraging party got on ahead.
1. 21. [2.] usus militaris imperiti, without the ‘scientia et usus' of Caesar’s veterans (2. 20).
1. 26. [3.] despecta paucitate, there must, however, have been nearly 2000 Roman infantry.
1. 28. [o. 40. n. 1.] deiecti, &c., * driven from hence by a charge, they tried to force their way into the line and among the companies/NOTES. BOOK VI, CHAP. 41-44.	307

GERGOVIA. ALESIA,
P. 135.1. i. [c. 1. n. i.] quieta Gallia, * the torrent’s smoothness ere it dash below.’ In 2. 35, 3. 28, Caesar had thought Gaul to be ‘quieta’ and ‘ pacata,’ yet disturbances had followed. But now there was to be an almost universal revolt, including even Caesar*s cherished Aedui. There is a kind of sincerity, in Caesar’s copying, from his diary here and elsewhere, expressions of opinion so much at variance with after circumstances.
1. 2. [2.] de Clodii caede. Worthless though he was, Clodius was x 2NOTES. BOOK VIT, CHAP. 3.
a partisan of Caesar, and therefore his slaughter by Milo was an affair of importance. The levies here alluded to were because Pompeius had declared the city to be in a state of siege on account of the tumult raised by the multitude for the loss of their favourite.
1. 3. [3.] certior factus, for * iussus: * see above, 3. 5, * certiores facit milites paulisper proelium intermitterent.*
1. 3. [4.] ut omnes iuniores Italiae ooniurarent, that there should be a muster on emergency throughout Italy. The name comes from the fact that in these hasty levies to meet a * tumultus' in Italy, the oaths were taken from the soldiers in a body, not from individuals. The form was (Servius on Aen. 8), that the general advanced holding two vexilla, and saying, * Qui vult rempublicam salvam me sequatur/
1. 6. [5.] addunt et affingunt, appended by their fictitious reports.
1. 8. [6.] in tantis dissensionibus, prepositional ablative absolute. See above, 1. 33, note 3.
1. 9. [7.] qui dolerent, the subjunctive (as in 5. 4, * qui iam ante in nos inimico animo fuisset *), to express * whereas even before they had been annoyed by their subjection to the Roman people/
1. 13. [8.] ad ipsos, emphatic reflexive: ‘on themselves, however unlikely such an event might now appear/
1. 15. [9.] praemiis deposcunt, &c.,4 they endeavoured, by all kinds of promises and offers of reward, to induce some one or other to come forward/ v	'
P. 136.1. 6. [c. 2. n. 1.] Carnutes. This was one of the most important nations of Gaul. Chartres and Genabum (Gien near Orleans) were their chief towns, the latter celebrated as an entrepot for the trade from the Saone to the Loire. The wealth thus derived, together with the fact that Caesar had not punished them for the murder of their king Tasgetius, and that they had not suffered in any of the former wars, may account for their forwardness at this time.
1. 9. [2.] ne res efferatur, since the very fact of their giving hostages would make the design public.
1. zi. [3.] ne deserantur, is the object to the verb 4sanciatur/ They asked for an oath and religious pledge to the effect that they should not be deserted after beginning the war. The pledge was to be by placing their standards dose together; which is their most binding religious guarantee.
1. 17. [c. 3. n. 1.] negotiandi causa. Kraner well explains this line by quoting Cic. pro Fonteio, ‘ Referta Gallia negotiatorum est, nemo Gallorum sine cive Romano quicquam negotii gerit; numus in Gallia nullus sine civium Romanorum tabulis commovetur/ The business wasNOTES. BOOK CHAP. 4-6»	309
money-lending, (unrestrained by Roman usury laws), the fanning of taxes, purchase of slaves or corn, and the like.
1. 24. [2.] ante primam confectam vigiliam. This was managed by means of a series of telegraphic towers (some of which still remain*) placed at distances of about 500 yards from one another. The message was passed either by cries or by fire signals. The Gauls were on the alert all along the line, as it had been agreed that the Camutes were to begin the war.
1. 28. [c. 4. n. 1.] principatum Galliae totius, before the Aedui had supplanted the Arverni: see 1. 31.
1. 31. [2.] facile incendit, understand ‘eos,* an unusual use of the abl. absolute for accusative of object; to express (as Mad wig, p. 377, points out) the sequence of events more clearly. For the same reason in 4. 13, we have ‘quos sibi Caesar oblatos gavisus, illos retineri iussit*
P. 137.1. 3. [3.] hao coacta manu, &c., ‘having collected a force of this kind, he drew over to his side all those of his countrymen to whom he could gain access.* ‘Adit* is the same as ‘aditum habet* in 1. 44.
1. 8. [4.] Senones, Parisios, &c. This great confederacy was an attempt to combine against Caesar the western and central nations of feaul, which as yet had hardly felt the war at all. It did not include the Aquitanians, who had been subdued by the younger Crassus in the campaign of 698 (3. 20), and who, besides, were not likely to sympathise with a purely Gallic movement. Nor were the Armoricans members of it (at least till after Caesar’s failure at Gergovia); for they remembered their crushing defeat in the same year (3. 10, sqq).
1.15. [5.] summae diligentiae: see 1. 40, note 6.
1. 17. [6.] maiore commisso delicto necat: see note 2 to this chapter.
1. 23- [7*] *n Rutenos, a Gallic nation in the Rouergue, on the upper Tarn and Aveyron.
1. 23. [8.] in Bituriges, understand * Cubos.* The modem names both of Berry and Bourges (Avaricum) seem to be derived from this ancient name. This nation was a subject ally of the Aedui, as the Cadurci and Tulobriges were of the Arvemi.
P. 138. 1. 6. [c. 0. n. 1.] virtute Gnei Pompei, ‘by the decisive measures of Pompey.* He had swept the streets of the Clodian mob; at the same time conciliating them by the condemnation of Milo, whom Cicero so falteringly defended.
1. 8. [2.] magna difficultate afficiebatur, &c., * he was in great Notes, book vii, chap. 8-io.
straits (to know) how to reach his army/ Cic. Rose. Am. 34, uses a similar ellipse, 4 cuius manu percussus sit, non laboro/
1. 9. [3.] si legiones arcesseret, he had to collect them from Treves, Langres, Sens (6. 44).
1. 18. [4.] antevertendum existimavit, a slightly antiquated expression. So Plautus uses the deponent (Bacch. 3. 5.1),
* rebus aliis antevortar Mnesilochum ut requiram/
1. 26. [c. 8. n. 1.] mons Cevenna, from ‘ kefyn/ a back (Zeuss). Even in the summer the passage offered some difficulty to an army, as we see from the dfoour made by the Helvetii to avoid it in Book 1. c. 12; and from the fact that the high road from Lyons to Rochelle passed (before railways were made) by Autun, Nevers, and thence along the Loire.
1. 27. [2.] durissimo tempore anni,4 on account of its being the severest season of the year* (the end of February). So as expressions of time we have 4 adventu Caesaris in Galliam/ 4 occasu solis/ and a few others in the simple ablative.
1. 29. [3.] viis patefactis, by Aps and S. Cirgues, on the direct way to Gergovia (Clermont). He had started from Vienne.
1. 29. [4.] summo militum sudore, these admirable soldiers were worthy of the genius of their chief. This whole operation deserves the closest attention.	,
P. 189.1. 4. [5.] neu (neve), the same as 4 et ne/ 4. 17, note.
1. 6. [6.] ad se bellum translatum, probably 4 that the whole war was transferred to them/ much as Com. Nep. Hann. 12, has 4 miserunt qui a Prusia rege peterent ne inimicissimum suum (sc. Romanorum) apud se haberet/ In both cases the reflexive is referred to a subject unusually distant.
1. 9. [c. 9. n. 1.] usu ventura. 4 would happen.' The order may be varied, as Cic. de Or. I. 40, 4 quid, quod usu memoria patrum venit/
4 Usu * is the dative here, like 4 equitatu/ 4 cornu/
1. 10. [2.] Brutum adulescentem. This was the Decimus Junius Brutus well known to Shakespeare readers. He could be left with safety, as he had a clear pass behind him, and Vercingetorix was far away to the north.
[3.] suis inopinantibus,4 without his own men having a notion what he was doing/ These admirable movements completely took away the initiative from Vercingetorix.
1. 23. [4.] Gorgobina. The Boii had been placed (1. 28) on the extreme edge of the Aeduan territory; and, apparently in the fork of the Loire and Allier, at or near S. Parize le Chatel. There are curious evidences that this spot was occupied by a tribe of foreigners. See Jules Cesar, 2, p. 248. As 4ob’ and ‘oban’ mean in Celtic 4 a port’ or a refuge, we may suppose that the names 4 Gergovia’ and 4 Gorgobina* are compounds of these words with 4 guerg/ strong.NOTES. BOOK VII, CHAP. II-T3.
1. 28. [o. 10. n. 1.] stipendiariis expugnatis, * if he allowed the tributaries of the Aedui to be captured.* Caesar had noticed, in 6. 11, that the first duty of a leader, according to Gallic opinion, was to secure his dependents.
1. 29. [a.] in eo: see 1. 5, note 5. ‘In se* would have meant ‘in themselves * here.
1. 31. [3.] ab re frumentaria: see 3. 25, note 4.
P. 140. 1. 5. [0.11. n. 1.] altero die, the order of days, when the ablative of time is used, is primo, altero, tertio (Cic. Phil. 13. 13). This rule does not however apply to 1 post tertium diem,’ and the like: see
9, note 1; 4. 28, note 1.
1. 6. [2.] Vellaunodunum; sufficient Gallic remains have been discovered to fix the site of this town at Triguferes, near the road from Sens to Gien and Orleans.
1. 7. [3.] expeditiore re frumentaria uteretur; in order that it might be possible to bring up his convoys (Litotes).
1. 12. [4.] Cenabum, almost certainly Gien, and not Orleans, as commonly thought. Caesar's object was to be as soon as possible at Gorgobina; to go to Orleans would have been sixty miles round, and would have involved the passage of marshes and forests. Besides this, the direct road from Sens to Orleans did not exist in Caesar’s time.
[5.] diei tempore exclusus, &c., ‘he was hindered from farther operation by the lateness of the hour.*
1. 19. [6.] pons continebat, a bridge was in the immediate rear of the town.
1- 25. [7.] perpaucis desideratis. Here the circumstance expressed by the ablative absolute accompanies or follows the main action instead of preceding it. So Livy 4. 10, ‘Volsci oppressi dederunt poenas, vix nuntio caedis relicto.’ This is rare.
1. 27. [8.] oppidum diripit, from the horrid fate of Avaricum presently we can judge what is included in this expression.
1. 32. [c. 12. n. 1.] Noviodunum; this cannot mean Nevers, since the place indicated must be about halfway between Gorgobina and Gien. It has therefore been fixed at Sancerre, where there still remain the substructures of a large Gallic city.
1. 33. [2.] ut sibi ignosceret; the reflexive refers back to ‘legati.* The meaning of the verb excludes all ambiguity.
P. 141.1. 1. [3.] celeritate, &c., ‘with the same rapidity with which he had accomplished the rest of his objects.’ The rapidity of the sentence is aided by the asyndeton.
1. 10. [4.] ex significatione, * from the demeanour* of the Gauls.
1. 14. [o.l3. n. 1.] Germanos; here we see the fruit of Caesar’s glowing description of the German cavalry in 1. 48. Vercingetorix (7. 18) also adopted the German cavalry tactics.31»
1.1$. [a.] ab initio, * from the beginning' of this war.
1. 20. [3.] seseque ei dediderant; the result of this surrender is not indicated here, and other authors do not supply the blank. Was there a ‘ sectio eius oppidi universa' (see the similar case in 2. 33), or did the growing fierceness of the conflict produce even fiercer measures ? The omission of all details makes us imagine that Caesar wished not to relate another tragedy like what he had to tell of Avaricum.
1. 21. [4.] Avaricom; for a plan of the town, see Jules C6sar (Plate . so), and for the description, see vol. 2, p. 255.
1. 22. [5.] agri fertilissima regione, 'in the most fertile part of the district occupied by them.’ 4 Regio' properly means * a line drawn from the eye onwards,' * a direction' (see above, 6. 25, note 3), and secondarily, * a line bounding a space ;* whence also ' a space,’ * an area.'
1. 27. [o. 14. n. 1.] atque antea gestum sit,' from that in which it had been managed before,' In the phrase ' pariter patribus ac plebi carus/ we probably have to understand * carus' after 4 patribus.' So we should write fully ‘illi sunt alio ingenio atque tu (alio).’ Hence * atque' generally assumes the meaning 4 than.'
1. 30. [2.] quod ipsi abundent, quasi-oblique: 4 because,’ he said, 4 they had large numbers of cavalry.'
1. 30. [3.] anni tempore, it was still March; and (2. 2) it was impossible to get even forage from the fields till June.
1. 31. [4.] necessario dispersos petere, &c., ‘were obliged to send detached parties to get com from the houses.’
P.142. 1. I. [5.] boo spatio quoqueversus, &c., 4 so far in all directions as the enemy seemed likely to go for foraging purposes.*
1. 6. [6.] a Boia. Scaliger enclosed these words in brackets; as the meaning evidently is that the country should be laid waste round the Romans wherever they were. Some editors have proposed to read 4 ab hoste.*
1. 6. [7.] ipsosne interficiant, if the former 4 ne' is omitted, the second alternative is generally introduced by 4ne,' as in Horace's question, ‘maiora minorane fama?' If it is expressed it is mostly followed by 4 an,* as in the phrase, ‘servus esne an liber,’ or Cic. Att. 16.8, 4 Romamne venio an hic maneo (an Arpinum fugiam ?).’
1. 9. [8.] munitione, ‘by the strength of their fortifications’ (l. 38, note 4.)
1. 9. [9.] loci natura,4 by the character of their site.*
1.10. [10.] neu Romanis proposita: see 4.17, last note.
[11.] gravius aestimare, understand 4 se.* 4 So he himself, he said, made much more account of their wives being led into captivity,’ &c. 4 Gravius,' as Kraner remarks, means 4 at a heavier rate.’
[12.] ilia ... in servitutem abstrahi ooniuges. Caesar would probably have written 4 ut abstrahantur ’ if he had intended3l3
the form of the expression to denote the likelihood of the supposition. This probability is however expressed only in the following words, ‘quae sit necesse accidere victis.’ Just so Cic. Leg. Man. 26, has first, ‘Quid tam inauditum, quam equitem Romanum triumphare? at eam quoque rem populus Romanus . . . videt,* and then, a few lines on, where the turn of the phrase implies, without any addition, the occurrence of the fact, ‘ at quid tam incredibile quam ut eques Romanus triumpharet ?’
[13.] quae sit necesse accidere, ‘ and this, he said, must necessarily happen to them if conquered.*
[o. 15. n. 1.] amplius viginti urbes: see 4.12, 3.
. 1.19. [2.] explorata victoria: see 2. 4, note 5.
L 22. [3.] pulcherrimam urbem; Avaricum was on the site of the present Bourges; but occupied more ground, as it contained 40,000 inhabitants. It was celebrated for its squares and open public places.
1. 24. [4.] loci natura, ‘ from the character of its site.* It was surrounded on all sides but that towards Moulins by marshes, which have now shrunk into the channels of the Yfevre, Y^vrette, and Auron. Its position was therefore like that of Shrewsbury or Durham; in a kind of loop with abrupt descents towards the streams. Moreover the neck of land between the marshes, by which it communicated with the adjoining country, was cut by a deep ravine, the bottom of which was eighty feet below the crest of the wall in that direction.
1. 28. [5.] precibus ... misericordia, ablativus normae; Kke ‘instituto suo,' &c. See 1. 4, 2.
1. 30. [c. 10. n. 1.] Caesarem subsequitur. Vercingetorix, after hanging on the left of Caesar’s march, had established himself probably near Dun le Roi, so as to draw his supplies from the Arvemian country.
P. 143.1. 2. [2.] dispersos adoriebatur, * attacked the men while scattered.’ Compare the wise policy of Cassivelaunus (5. 19).
1. 4. [3.] ab nostris occurrebatur, &c., * although as much as could be done by calculation was accomplished by our men to remedy the difficulty by going (namely that they went) at various hours of the day.’
1. 5. [4.] ut iretur appears to be in apposition with • quantum.*
1. 13. [o. 17. n. 1.] alteri non magnis facultatibus, understand * cum essent.' See 1. 18, note 2 ; and 1. 39, note 2.
[2.] extremam famem sustentarent, ‘bore up against excessive hunger.* The imperfect subjunctive here marks that the consumption of cattle lasted all through the time during which the supply of corn was short. In Bell. Civ. i. 48, Caesar calls meat a ‘ secundum subsidium ’ for the corn-diet to which the soldiers were accustomed.
1. 21. [3.] in opere, ‘ legions engaged in the work.*314	NOTES. BOOK VI .l8-2r,
1. 24. [4.] meruisse: * that they had served without ever suffering a single defeat.’
1. 26. [5.] laturos si reliquissent; the actual words of the soldiers (of which these are the oblique form) were • feremus si reliquerimus.'
1. 28. [6.] quam non parentarent, understand * ut.' So Cic. Tusc.
2. 22, ‘perpessus est omnia potius quam conscios ... indicaret/ For the word see Ov. Fasti, 2. 546.
1. 33« [70 propius Avaricum, on the eastern side.
P. 144.1. 1. [0.18.] inter equites: see note 1, on 7. 13, note 1.
1. 11. [c. 19. n. 1.] non latior, &c., * although not more than fifty feet wide.'
1. 12. [2.] generatim in civitates, ‘state by state, according to their extraction.'
1. !3- [3 ] vada ac saltus, ‘ all the shallow points and all approaches to the bog.' By • saltus ’ appear to be meant the descents of the hill between its projecting buttresses.
1. 15. [4.] ex loco superiore; see 3. 4, and 3. 14, where this advantage is fully dwelt on.
1. 16. [5.] ut existimaret, &c., * and that in such a manner that every one who saw the nearness of their position thought that they were ready for battle on almost even terms/
1. 18. [6.] inani simulatione. This is rather hard on the Gauls , as Caesar had used the same means of defence against the Belgian confederacy (2. 8). We see a shade of vexation at the failure of his well-devised coup-de-main. It is curious to compare the expressions here with those used in c. 52, in narrating the same event.
1. 25. [7.] sua salute cariorem, ‘ dearer than his own welfare/
P. 145. 1. 5. [c. 20. n. 1.] persuasum, &c., ‘as for his having approached nearer to the Romans, this course had been recommended to him by the admirable character of the position/
1. 5. [2.] se ipsum, ‘ which defended itself by its own strength * (compare I. 38, ‘oppidum natura loci sic muniebatur/ ‘was so strong by the very character of its site’). There was no need for altering * ipsum * to ‘ ipse' (as some editors do), as we have in Cic. (pro Com. 2),
‘ dicere de ipso,’ and the reflexive may therefore be in the object.
1. 6. [3.] neque desiderari debuisse, &c., * on the one hand ought not to have been wanted in so marshy a position, and on the other had been useful where they went.’
1. 18. [4.] ipsis remittere, &c., ‘he offered to resign it at once to them.'
1. 25. [5.] si quid reperire possent,1 to try if they could find anything.’
P. 140. 1. 2. [0. 21. n. 1.] concrepat: see Tac. Germ. 11, where the clash of arms is in like manner mentioned as a mode of assent.NOTES. BOOK VII, CHAP. 22, 2$,
1. 8. [2.] paene in eo si retinuissent, their final triumph depended mainly on the point of their retaining this city. Though most MSS. read • penes eos,* this correction seems almost necessary. The saving of Avaricum was necessary to them rather negatively than positively; to lose it was ruin, but to keep it was not victory.
1. 11. [0. 22. n. I.] occurrebant, as in 7. 16, note 3.
1. 11. [2.] ut est summae genus sollertiae; see 3. 8, note 4.
1. 13. [3.] laqueis falces avertebant. The ‘falces* seem to have been a kind of battering ram with both a point and a hook. See Jules C6sar (vol. 2, p. 128, note). The nooses were employed, as in the great siege of Plataea (Thuc. 2. 76), first to break the blow by turning it in an oblique direction, and then by drawing the sliding knot tight, to drag the ram from its position by means (apparently) of windlasses.
1. 18. [4.] turribus; see 5. 40, note 1.
1. 22. [5.] commissis suarum turrium malis seems to mean ‘by adding fresh lengths of scaffolding: * for the verb implies actual contact; and therefore Kraner’s interpretation ‘ by building together the scaffolding poles,* seems hardly admissible.
1. 23. [6.] apertos cuniculos, • and, when we opened mines, they countermined them from above; and from their own gallery sometimes thrust sharpened stakes into the line of ours; sometimes poured boiling pitch upon our working parties, sometimes even dropped into our galleries pieces of rock large enough to close them up for the time.*
1. 26. [c. 23. n. 1.] trabes directae, beams laid at right angles to the trace of the wall.
1. 26. [2.] perpetuae in longitudinem, and continued round the whole enceinte.
1. 29. [3.] vestiuntur. These timbers are framed together by ties, filled in with earth, and riveted with blocks of stone occupying the two-foot intervals between beam-head and beam-head.
1. 32. [4.] neque inter se contingant trabes, the second course was entirely of stones: this was then continued by a third alternating with the first in the position of its timber and stone. That this is the meaning is proved by a representation of such a wall on Trajan's column.
P. 147.1. 2. [5.] cum . .. deforme non est: the indicative is used here, as it would have been if the phrase had been *est, cum non deforme, tum opportunum.* So Cic. ad Fam. 3. 9, has * quum ipsam cognitionem iuris augurii consequi cupio, tum tuis incredibiliter studiis delector.’ Madwig, p. 313. The principle of the architecture is that of the beautiful old houses in Shrewsbury, Chester, Rouen, Warwick, &c.
1. 6. [6.] quae perpetuis trabibus, * for as its beams extend inwards without interruption for forty feet, and are also firmly bolted together, they cannot be either breached or drawn.*316	notes. BOOK VII, CHAP. 24-28.
1- 9. [0. 24. n. 1.] cum tardarentur, 'and although they were also delayed.*
1. 12. [3.] pedes octoginta, so as to reach (‘contingere’) from the bottom of the ravine to the crest of the parapet.
1. 17. [3.] toto muro, ‘ along the whole of the ramparts.*
1. 23. [4.] instituto Caesaris, abi. normae: ‘ according to Caesar*s standing order.’ See 1. 50, note I.
1. 24. [5.] celeriter factum est, * measures were speedily taken.*
1. 25. [6.] turres reducerent, • should withdraw the towers of attack.*
I.30. [o. 25. n. 1.] pluteos, ‘the skin-covered mantlets:* without these the towers could easily be fired by the enemy.
1. 33. [a.] vestigio temporis 5 literally, * spot of time.* So in 4. 2, we have ‘ eodem vestigio,* for ‘ the same spot,* as regards space.
P. 148. 1. 12. [c. 26. n. 1.] profugere, the infinitive is used, because 4 consilium ceperunt * is equivalent to 4 statuerunt.*
L 16. [2.] tardabat, for ‘tardatura erat.*

From his six legions^ Caesar chose twenty cohorts; the remaining forty were re-divided so as to have the appearance of six legions. The passage was probably made at Va- rennes. Vercingetorix, barbarian-like, had neglected the precaution of watching his rear as he advanced. How carefully a good general does this, we may see by Lord Wellington’s works constructed in his rear, while triumphantly advancing to the Pyrenees in 1810 (as described by Gleig in ‘The Subaltern*).

Gergovia was four miles south of the present Clermont; situated on a high plateau, inaccessible except from the south, where the ground rises in steep terraces, and from the left, where its plateau is formed by a nearly level neck with the height of Rissolles. On the south, about a mile from the town, is a peculiar scarped hill called the Roche Blanche. On the south-east of the town are some low heights sloping down to the ancient lake of Sarlifeves, now drained. Two streams, the Artieres on the north and the Auzon on the south, were the only watering-places for the defenders, except the springs in the town. See plate 21 to Jules Cesar, vol. 2, and the placat p. 137.

F. 156.1. 4. [4.] manus tendere. Kraner remarks that, if these three infinitives were co-ordinate, the conjunction would not be used with any of them.

1. 6. [c. 47. n. 1.] consecutus id quod animo proposuerat. The author of Jules Cdsar, as well as other commentators less favourable to Caesar, consider this to mean that he wished now to withdraw his troops, pretending that the object of his whole attack was accomplished; and they proceed to say how different Caesar’s intentions must really have been. But on this view of his real intention, the moment when he halted his troops would have been just that when the * occasio ’ when he had sought, and the nature of which is indicated by his statements about the distance to the foot of the wall, was absolutely in his hands; and when he could hardly have helped knowing that it was so,

Moreover lie would have been ordering the retreat before there was any. show of organized resistance. It seems more probable that the recall sounded by Caesar was intended to make the advanced legions fall back upon himself; that the words * consecutus id quod animo proposuerat *. mean * finding himself in possession of the opportunity he desired ;* that is, that he had been thus far successful, and that if the other legions had heeded his recall he would have reformed his troops and led them on to a regular assault. As it was, the remaining legions, by their reckless onset, entirely broke up his formation, and must themselves have left behind the ladders, &c. with which, as an assault was intended, they must of course have been provided.

The unequal division of his troops seems intended to give an advantage to one of his detachments, as the enemy would probably divide their forces more equally. He of course hazarded the detachment which went north, a risk which could not have been ventured in presence of a . more skilful enemy.

The Volcae naturally held off from the confederacy, as from their isolated position (see 2. 1, note 2) among hostile nations the Roman power was a support to them. The Helvii probably feared the Arvemi and were therefore inclined to Rome.NOTES. BOOK VII, CHAP. 6$,
P. 168.1. 4. [4.] superiore bello, the Allobroges had been fearfully : oppressed by Fonteius, whom Cicero so strangely and inconsistently defended. They had earned the gratitude of the senate by revealing the Catiline conspiracy; but not satisfied with its results, they rose and were crushed in B.C. 63. (See Thierry, lib. 5, c. 2, fin.)

To get there from Gergovia he would ford the Loire at Bourbon Lancey, turn north so as to avoid the now hostile • Aeduan country (and at the same time to effect his junction with Labienus) as far as Joigny or thereabouts; then strike across by way of Langres, cross the Saone at Gray or Pontaillier, and so arrive at Besan£on. The battle now to be described was on the river Vingeanne, just east of Dijon. See Jules C6sar (plate 24).

Vercingetorix advanced from Bibracte by way of Thil Chatel and formed three camps on eminences, south of the Roman position, so as to command the three possible ways to Besan^n, that by Gray, that by Pontaillier, and that by Chalons sur Saone. He hoped in this way to be able to attack Caesar’s army while still in column, as it neared the heights of Sacquenay on which he was posted.

His researches have discovered the walls of the town, the Gallic camps, the lines of circumvallation, the positions of several of Caesar*s redoubts, the trace of his ditches, the soil deposited by the water drawn into them from the rivers, and the trace of the Roman camps. Finally the places where, according to the narrative, most of the enemy were slain have been detected by the abundance of coins, arrow-heads, &c., found there, and a line of barrows has been found to mark the resting-places of those who fell on the retreat See the fine plan (Plate 25), or the sketch given in the text.

The manoeuvre was like Sir S. Smith’s at Acre, in sending round men to attack in rear the French, who were trying to storm the breach (Thiers’ Revolution, c. 63).- 1. 28. [6.] equites occurrunt, the asyndeton construction brings out here almost too strongly the rapidity of the defeat. In fact, many circumstances must have been omitted in this rapid and somewhat theatrical close with the characters grouped, as it were, round Caesar’s scarlet cloak. The honours of the campaign manifestly belonged to the German cavalry. They gained the battle of the Vingeanne; drove the Gallic horse before them on arriving at Alesia; routed the combined cavalry and archers in the assault of c. 80; and now made Labienus’ sally effective by taking the enemy in rear.

1. 22. [o. 4. n. 1.] ducenos sestertios, a guinea and a half nearly.. To find, however, the real value of such a donative, the only way is to ascertain the quantity of com which it would have bought. This was about fifty-seven modii, as a modius fetched about three and a half sesterces at this time (Verr. 3. 70). A modius, again, contained 20 lbs.33<S	NOTES.	BOOK	VIII, CHAP. 5-9.
of com; therefore the fifty-seven would equal 1140 lbs., or 2J quarters of wheat. Thus the gift was worth about six pounds of our money to the soldier.
1. 23. [2.] tot milia nummum, in words like ‘mille/ the second I is dropped when i follows. Thus Messalla becomes Messalina, and villa vilicus. If the reading is correct (which is improbable, as ‘ tot * is not used for' totidem’), the donative of a centurion was ten times that of a private; while his regular proportion was only twice as much (Liv. 45. 40). Some editors read ‘ duplicem summam.' Kraner ingeniously proposes * ad m. milia' (one MS. has ‘ ad ii'). Thi9 would be 48,000 sesterces to be divided among the 120 centurions, at the rate of 400 each.

Instead of crossing these marshes directly, he bore somewhat to the right, got over without opposition (as the enemy had no good communication with the hill which he ascended), and established himself on the M.

This will be shown by the following notes. For the position of Uxellodunum, see the map at 3. 20. The name of the town is really

In 699 his command was renewed, after a scene of unparalleled violence in the senate (Merivale, 1, p. 240). The question about the time limits of Caesar’s government was considered, even by Cicero, as an obscure one. It is fully discussed in Jules Cesar, vol. 3, p. 472.

1. 8. [2.] cuniculos tectos, an underground gallery. This has been traced through all its length, as the paters of the upper spring still discharge themselves through it as Caesar made them do.

By 'coloniae' the author means those military colonies of old foundation, like Parma and Mutina, which had enjoyed the Roman franchise from the first, and were so distinguished from the coloniae Latinae, such as Bononia, Aquileia, and Placentia, formed when the Roman senate had begun to dread decentralization (Mommsen, vol. 2, p. 334). The ‘municipia’ (here mentioned) are either allied states or Latin colonies, such as Pisa and the last-mentioned towns, which had the full Roman franchise, and also their own internal administration, in virtue of the Julian law of B.C. 90 (Monlmsen, vol. 3, p. 249).
