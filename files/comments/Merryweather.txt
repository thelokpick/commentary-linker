Unam-aliam—tertiam. “ One—another—a third; ” not “one—a second—a third,” which would be imam—alteram, etc. Cp. 2, 2.
ipsorum lingua. For sua ipsorum. The oblique cases of ipse are often used for suum ipsius, sibi ipsi, etc.; the adjective ipse in these cases (as always in classical Latin) emphasizing the word to which it is attached. The emphasis here is due to the antithesis between sua lingua and nostra, which would be expressed in Greek by pbr and 9L Cp. 13, 4, etc.
nostra. Although Caesar’s history is written in the third person, yet he constantly uses nos, noster for Romani, Roman- orum; nostra lingua—Latina lingua.	See note on Reported,
Speech, IV. note.
lingua. [§ 116.]
dividit. [N. S. I. 3, a. p. 133.]
cultu atque humanitate. Cultus indicates the outward characteristics of civilisation (dress, habits of life, etc.); humanitas, the moral characteristics (refinement of thought and feeling, education, etc.).
provinciae. A word of doubtful etymology (perhaps from
BOOK L]	Dprovidentia), and used originally of a department of the public service intrusted to the oversight of an official. Thus the phrase urbana provincia is used in Livy (XXXI. 6); but the later and common sense of the word is “ territory outside Italy subject to Rome. ” When used without further definition,provincia, as here, means the Provincia Narbonensis. See Geogr. Index. This name still survives in Provence.
mercatores. " Traders, ” who in this case would come chiefly from the great Greek mercantile town Massilia (Marseilles).
proximi. Propior and proximus are constructed (1) with dative, as here : (2) with accusative ; propius tumtduin, 46, 1; proximus mare Oceanum, III. 7, 2 : (3) with a or ab ; proximus ab aliquo, meaning “next after some one.’*
Germanis. “ Those Germans who live beyond the Rhine.” incolunt. Here, as often, intransitive. Cp. 5, 3; 54, 1. finibus. [§ 123.]
Eorum. I. e. of the three peoples mentioned in section 1 as occupying Gaul. Notice also the two senses of the word Gallia: (1) as the name of the whole country in section 1; (2) as the name of the territory of the Galli (Celtae) in section 5.
Oceano. Oceanus, or Mare Oceanum (III. 7, 2), is the Latin name for the Atlantic generally; the reference here is to that part of the Atlantic now called the Bay of Biscay.
ab Sequanis. “On the side of the Sequani.” Cp. a tergo, a fronte, a novissimo agmine, 23, 3.
vergit. Lit. “it slopes ; ” probably referring to the general inclination of the country in regard to its watershed and the course of its rivers. Cp. spectant in section 5: “have a (northern) aspect.” septentriones. The etymology of this word is not certain. The Romans thought it w^s derived from septem-triones, the seven ploughing-oxen, trio being an Old Latin vulgar word with that sense. Professor M. Muller thinks that this derivation is probably a false analogy, and that trio is rather connected with the root of stella—sterula, Greek d-erfy), Germ, stern, Eng. star, the initial s having been lost, so that trio—strio means *‘ a star; ” and septentriones, the seven stars of Ursa Major or Charles’s Wain. The use of the singular septentrio arose when the distinct meaning of the two parts of the word had been melted together into one notion, “the North.”inferiorem partem fl. Rh. The lower part of the river, i.e. towards its mouth.
earn partem Oceani. Tho S.E. angle of the Bay of Biscay, called by the Romans the sinus Cantdbricus.
2.
M. Messala et M. Pisone cons. b.c. 61. In phrases like this the conjunction is more commonly dropped (asyndeton). Cp. 6, 3; 35, 4.
regni cupiditate. [§ 132.]
esse. Infinitive of principal clause in oratio obliqua; dependent on “he said,” understood from persuasit» cum—praestarent. [§ 151.] omnibus. Dative [§ 106, a], imperio potiri. [§ 119, a.]
hoc facilius. Hoc is ablative of measure [N. S. V. E. p. 137].
flumine Rheno—qui. The relative agrees with the masculine noun Rhenus, not with flumine ; so below, flumine Rhodano, qui. But in 12,1, flumen Arar, quod. So II. 5, 4; II. 18, 1.
qua ex parte. “In which respect;” lit. “from which side.** Cp. omni exparte, “in all respects.”
bellandi cupidi. [§ 132.]
Pro. “In proportion to.” This meaning of pro comes from its other sense of “in the place of;” so, “in return or requital for.”
multitudine hominum. See 29, 2. milia passuum. [§ 34, p. 19.] The Roman unit in measuring distance was the pace (passus) of five Roman feet, from the point where the foot is taken up to that where the same foot is put down. The Roman mile measured 4850 English feet, or *919 English mile. For the use of the accusative, see on 8, 1.
milia passuum ccxl. Notice that Caesar generally places the cardinal numbers after milia, not, as usual elsewhere, before it. See the rule [N. E. IY. A. e. (4), p. 129].
patebant. Indicative, because it expresses a matter of fact. If it had been intended to give part of their thought {arbitrabantur), i.e. the reason why their territory seemed to be too narrow, paterent would have been used, as subordinate oratio obliqua [§ 151], and as pertinerent is used below, 3. 13.
jumentorum. From the root jug, whence jugum, “a yoke;” applied to animals trained to bear the yoke, draught-horses, or oxen.
carrorum. Two-wheeled carts, which, with the redae (51, 2) of four wheels, were used by the Helvetii and Germans to carry the baggage of their armies, and their wives and children.
quam maximum numerum. An elliptical phrase for the fuller tam magnumt quam maximum.
coemere. 44 Buy upthe co{n) strengthens the force of the simple verb. 44 To buy from all quarters.” sementes (nom. sing, sementis). From sero, to sow. SZro is for s&so (see on 46, 4), and sSmentis for s&smentis.
Notice the asyndeton between the infinitives comparare— co&mere—facere—confirmare.
in tertium annum. “ For the third year following.” The preposition in is constantly used with the accusative, where no actual motion is implied, to express the limit of time or space to which you measure. Cp. 2, 4, in longitudinem, in latitudinem.
4. regnum. There was no monarchy in the usual sense of the word amongst the Gauls; regnum here means the despotic ascendancy which powerful chiefs often attained over their tribe, multos annos. [§ 102.]
obtinuerat. “ Had held.” This is the proper meaning of obtinere, though it is not unfrequently used in the sense of its English derivative “ obtain,” as below, in section 5 and in 18, 5.
a senatu pop. Rom. amicus appellatus erat. The titles of “friend” and “king ” were honorary distinctions granted by the Homan senate to foreign princes in reward for services, or to flatter and conciliate a dangerous rival, e.g. Ariovistus (35, 2).
principatum. Distinct from regnum} and implying the influential position in his tribe of a man of high birth, wealth, and military distinction. “Who at that time held a leading position in his state.” plebi acceptus, [§ 106, (3). ] Acceptus is here an adjective, not a participle. Cp. exercitatus, 36, 7; confertus, 24, 3,
6. factu. [§ 141, 6.]
propterea quod—esset. “Because (he said) he was.” See on patebant, 2, 4.non esse dubium, quin. [App. II. (C), V. 2, (2), p. 167.]
totius Galliae. [N. S. VI. C. 3, p. 139.] copiis. “ Resources." Cp. 31, 6; 11.10,4. conciliaturum. “ Procure.” confirmat. “Affirms.”
jusjurandum. Lit. “the swearing one’s rights hence of taking any oath.
per tres—populos. Per with an accusative is regularly used instead of the ablative of the instrument, when the instrument is a person or persons. Cp. per indicium—per indices, 4,1, etc.
totius Galliae potiri. Potior, more generally constructed with the ablative (of means or instrument), as in 2, 1, sometimes takes the genitive according to [§ 133].
sese—posse sperant. Verbs of hoping, promising, etc., are regularly followed by the future infinitive, except in the case of posse, where the meaning of the word contains a reference to the future.
4.
per indicium. “By informers” (indices), Cp. use of servilia for servi; and see above, 3, 6.
enuntiata. See on 17, 8.
Moribus suis. [§ 114.] See on ejus voluntate, 7, 3. ex vinclis causam dicere. “To plead, make his defence, in chains. ” Cp. pugnare ex equo,11 to4fight on horseback. ” damnatum. Object of sequi, of which poenam is the subject; and the whole infinitive clause is subject of the impersonal verb oportebat. See [N. S. IX. F. b. (2), p. 145.] “The punishment which would necessarily follow his condemnation was that,” etc. ut—cremaretur. Explaining poenam. See on 5, 1. igni. The usual ablative of ignis. Cp. 53, 7.
Die constituta. [§ 120.]
causae dictionis. Notice the not common idiom of a double genitive. Causae is the objective genitive after dictionis [§ 132]; dictionis is the ordinary attributive genitive after die. Dies causae dicendae (dative of purpose) would have been a more usual expression.
familiam. “ Slaves. ”ad—milia decem. Ad with numbers, like Greek efr, has the sense of * ‘ about ” or “ to the number of. ” Cp. 5,2; 29, 2.
clientes obaeratosque. The Gallic nobles had large numbers of dependants, who, originally freemen, had, through inability to pay their debts, or by acts of oppression on the part of the nobles, been deprived of their independence (see VI. 13, 2), so that the obaerati were one kind of clientes. The word cliens comes from the old verb cluo (Gr. k\6w), to hear, or obey ; it is used of the dependants of a state in 31, 6.
eripuit se ne, etc. I.e. by intimidating his judges. The ne, as always, is a final particle, and expresses Orgetorix’ purpose. [§ 152, I. (2).]
Cum—conaretur. [§ 153 (1).] neque abest suspicio quin. [App. II. (C), V. 2, (2), p. 167.]
mortem sibi consciverit. “Committedsuicide.”
5.
ut e finibus suis exeant. A subjunctive after ut, as here, or an infinitive, as in 7, 1, is often added to explain more clearly the reference of a preceding clause. Cp. 4, 1, ut cremaretur; III. 22, 2, etc.
oppida. Walled towns, in distinction from vicos, unfortified villages (the same word as the Greek ofror for f oik os); whilst privata aedificia means the homesteads not included in either the oppida or vici. Cp. II. 7, 3. ad duodecim. See on 4, 2.
domum reditionis. Domum is the accusative of motion to a place [§ 101] after the verbal substantive in do, used as equivalent to a gerund here, and not uncommonly in Plautus and Terence. Cicero has domum itionem (dc Div. I. 32, 68). So obtemperatio legibus (de Legg. 1.15, 42), where the verbal substantive is constructed with the same case as the verb from which it is derived.
mensum. The usual form of the genitive plural of mensis, as if from a nominative singular mens; but mensium also occurs. For the use of the genitive here, see [§ 128]; it defines the kind of cibaria by their amount, molita. Part, perfect passive, from molo, mottre. cibaria. * ‘ Soldiers’ provisions; ” here —frumentum.domo. [§ 121, C. a.]
oppidis suis—una cum iis. Suis refers to the subject of its own verb, proficiscantur; iis refers to the subject of the main verb, persuadent, and is therefore an exception to the rule. See the note on Se and Suus, II. (a), and IV., and cp. 6, 2 ; 14, 2 ; 37, 2, for similar exceptions.
6.
itinera—quibus itineribus. It is a very common practice with Caesar to repeat the antecedent with its relative. Perhaps we may trace in it the influence of the formal phraseology of law documents and state papers. Cp. section 3, diem, qua die, and many other instances.
possent. [§ 150.]
Yix qua. Vix is placed first for the sake of emphasis. Cp. 25, 3, multi—ut praeoptarent; and III. 4, 1. Qua is an adverb.
singuli carri. The distributive numeral means here “one at a time,” i.e. in single file, ducerentur. [§ 150.]
prohibere. The object is understood from the context:
* ‘ bar the passage. ” provinciam nostram. See 1, 1, and 1, 3. pacati. See Oeogr. Index, “Allobroges.” nonnullis locis. Ablative of “place where” without a preposition. [N. S. V. 0.1, p. 137.] transitur. I.e. transiripotest; “it is forded,” and therefore “is fordable.”
bono animo. [§115.]
viderentur. [§ 151.] The subjunctive shows that this was the reason in the mind of the Helvetii for thinking that they could persuade the Allobroges. See on 2, 4, patebant.
coacturos. The object is to be supplied from Allobrogibus above.
per suos fines eos. See on 5, 3, oppidis suis—una cum iis.
conveniant. [§ 150.]
a. d. V. Kal. Apr. [N. E. p. 131.] “The original signification of the expression ante diem quintum Kalendas Apriles seems to have been * before (on the fifth day) the Kalends of April,’ the exact day being thrown in parentheti-cally, and then attracted from the ablative ease [§ 120] to the accusative in consequence of following ante” which really governs Kalendas (Roby, Lat. Or. vol. i. p. 451).
L. Pisone, A. Gabinio. The date of their consulship was b c. 58.
7.
id—eos conari. See on 5, 1.
nuntiatum esset. For the mood, see [§ 153, (1)]. The tense follows the rule that when a dependent sentence in the subjunctive precedes a principal sentence which has a historic present, the verb of the dependent sentence is generally in a historic tense (Roby, § 1512).
Galliam ulteriorem = Galliam transalpinam. See Introductum, § 2 (2).
ad Genavam pervenit. “ Advances as far as Geneva; ” not to Geneva, which would not require the preposition. Plutarch says that this journey was accomplished in eight days.
legio una. Apparently the tenth legion. See note on Army, § 2.
civitatis. [N. S. VI. C. 3, p. 139.]
legatos cujus legationis. See 6, 1. For the genitive, see reference on civitatis above.
qui dicerent. [§ 150.]
nullum. Placed last, out of its natural order, for the purpose of emphasis* “ Because other route they had none.”
rogare. Notice the omission of the subject (se), which is common in oratio obliqua, except with nos and vos.
ejus voluntate. [§ 113.] The ablative of manner is generally with an attribute, either an adjective or a genitive case, except in some old phrases (e.g. jure, sponte), and where the ablative might be loosely regarded as an ablative of the instrument (Roby, § 1236).
liceat. Notice the mixture of historic and primary sequences. The use of the primary tense here is probably to mark the reference to the future implied in the infinitive rogare, whilst in the first part of the speech (haberent) the reference is to present time. They said, “We have (now) no other route; we ask you to allow us (presently) to take this route." See note on Reported Speech, III. note (4). Cp. the parallel case in II. 14,2.memoria. [§ 112.]
sub jugum missum. The practice is described by Livy, III. 28: “ Tribus hastis jugum fit, humi fixis duabus, superque eas transversa una deligata. ” Under the yoke or arch so made the soldiers of the conquered army were compelled to pasB one by one, in token of complete submission to the victors, the yoke being the badge of slavery. The custom was Roman, but adopted by foreigners from them. Gp. the famous case at the Furculae Caudinae in the Samnite war (Livy, IX. 56). homines inimico animo. [§ 115.] quos imperaverat. See above on section 2. For indicative, see on 2, 4, patebant.
dum convenirent. Dum meaning “until” takes the subjunctive, except when the verb refers to a fact in the past [§ 152, III. (1)]. diem sumpturum. “Take time'9 ad Idus. Ad with dates as with numerals, “ about” See on 4, 2. [N. E. p. 131.] reverterentur. The oratio obliqua equivalent for the imperative of oratio recta. See note on Reported Speech, II. (c).
8.
ea legione militibusque. The ablative of the instrument [§ 112] is often used instead of the ablative of the agent with ab [§ 122, 5] in speaking of bodies of troops. Cp. 15, 3 ; 53, 3; II. 10, 3. milia passuum. [N. S. IX. G. c. (2), p. 146.] decem novem. Contrary to the usual rule of compound numbers under twenty. [N. E. IV. A. e. (1), p. 129.]
in altitudinem pedum sedecim. The principal forms of expression for space measured [N. S. IX. G. c. (3), p. 146] are— (1.) Accusative [§102]; e.g. fossae XVpedes latae. Cp. 2, 4. (2.) Ablative [§ 118]; latum pede est.
(3.) Genitive [§ 128]; fossa XIX pedum. Cp. II. 5, 6.
(4.) Genitive depending on an ablative, or accusative with in, of the abstract substantive (altitudo, Aongitudo, etc.), as in this passage. See note on 3, 2. murum—fossamque perducit. These words must not be taken to imply that Caesar built a stone wall and dug a fosse for the whole length of the nineteen miles from the Lakeof Geneva to Pas de PEclnse (see Plan in text, p. 19). Such a work could hardly have been completed in the time at his disposal, from two to three weeks ; and, if possible, would have been unnecessary, since the steep cliffs, between which the Rhone flows swiftly in this part of its course, would in most places be a sufficient natural barrier. That no traces of any stone fortifications are to be found makes it almost certain that Caesar only strengthened the weak points of the line by earthworks, and the murus and fossa will then refer to the natural cliff-wall, dug out at the base, wherever it was necessary to raise its sheer height to sixteen (Roman) feet. Behind this Caesar placed, at intervals, fortified posts or redoubts (castella), garrisoned by his troops. (See Napoleon’s Julius Caesar, voL ii. pp. 57, 58.)
 castella. For caslcrulum, a diminutive of castrum, like puella for puerula from puer.
se invito. [8 125, a.] For use of se, see note on Sc and Suus, II. (a).
conarentur. Imperfect subjunctive used for the future subjunctive. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (2).
possit. When a subjunctive (possit) dependent on a historic present (communit) has another subjunctive dependent on it (conarentur), the former is often in a primary tense (Roby, § 1514); hence the use of possit as compared with conarentur.
more et exemplo populi R. See on 7, 3, ejus
voluntate.	[§114.]
ulli. Ullus and quisquam are seldom used, except after negatives and comparative adjectives.
spe. [§ 123.]
alii. I.c. “others of the Helvetii,” corresponding to an unexpressed alii implied before navibus.
interdiu. Diu is ablative of an old word dius—dics. Cp. nudiustertius=nunc dies tertius ; dudum = diudum ; diumus.
conati, si possent, etc. “Made an attempt to break through, if possible. ” The si-possent does not depend on conati, but is part of a conditional sentence in oratio obliqua. Lit. “they made an attempt, (thinking that) if they could break through (they would)” (Roby, § 1754). Cp. the parallel passage in II. 9, 1.
conatu. [§ 123.]9.
una is emphatic: “one, and only one way, that through the S., remained.’* The order of words is noticeable : “per Sequanos” separates the adjective una from its noun via, to show that the prepositional phrase qualifies the noun and not the verb (relinqucbaticr).
Sequanis invitis. [§125, a.] “Without the leave of the S.”
sua sponte. Lit, “On their own responsibility,’* sponte and spondeo belonging to the same root. Two uses of the phrase are to be distinguished, as equivalent to (1) “voluntarily,** of an action not forced on the actors by others; (2) “singly ** of an action done without others’ help. The latter, which is the rarer use, belongs to this passage.
eo deprecatore. “ By his intercession.” [§ 125, a.]
impetrarent. The object is to be supplied from the context.
gratia. “Popularity.”
regni. [§ 132.]
novis rebus studebat. “Was eager for a revolution.” Novae res9 “ a change in the state of (political) affairs.” Cp. the use of res in the meaning of “ politics ” in res capessere, etc. So too novae tabulae means “a change of ledgers,” t.e. an abolition of debts. For the dative with studebat, [§ 107].
suo beneficio. Ablative. “ By benefits conferred by himself.”
dent. The subject of dent is “ Sequani ct Helvetii” as is plain from the context. If any ambiguity had been possible, the change of subject between the co-ordinate verbs, patiantur —dent would have been marked, as usual.
ne-prohibeant—ut-transeant. The purpose of the exchange of hostages.
10.
absunt— est. The mood of these verbs shows that^they are not part of the report (oratio obliqua), but explanations added by the writer of the narrative for his readers’ sake.
si fleret—futurum. Conditional sentence in oratio
obliqua depending on intellegebat.	See note on Reported
Speech, II. (d), note (3).
locis patentibus. “An undefended country,” i.e. with no protection, natural or artificial, against invaders.legatum. See note on Army, § 5 (b)t Italiam, l.e, Gallia citerior, S. of the Alps. See Introduction, § 2 (1).
magnis itineribus. •• Making all speed.’’ The phrase is regularly used of the “forced marches ” of an army.
duas legiones conscribit. The senate had given Caesar four legions; the tenth (mentioned 7, 2) and probably the three at Aquileia. The other two he seems to have raised on his own authority. See note on Army, § 1.
conscribit. The technical term for levying troops, referring to the making up of the roll of names of the soldiers called out.
circum A. hiemabant. Winter quarters, hibema (see note on Army, § 10) were generally not in, hut near a town.
Compluribus his proeliis pulsis. The his refers to the tribes above mentioned, and is ablative absolute [§ 125], pulsis agreeing with it; compluribus proeliis [§ 113]. The awkward conjunction of ablatives is parallel to 111. 6, 3, copiis fusis armisque exutis, ulterioris provinciae. “ A part of the transalpine province” (Provincia), as distinguished from provincia citerior (Gallia Cisalpina). [§ 130.]
11.
cum—possent. [§ 153 (1).] And for use of imperfect, , see 7, 1, nimtiatum esset.
rogatum. [§ 141, 5.]
Ita se, etc. The oratio obliqua begins at once, without any verb of saying expressed to introduce it; but the verb is easily supplied from rogatum, “ (Who said) that they had so,” etc.
omni tempore. “ At all times.” Ablative of time in the course of which the action takes place ; not during, i,e. throughout which, where the accusative would be required. Cp. 26, 2, hocioto proelio, etc. nostri. See note on Reported Speech, IV. note ; and on 1,1. liberi eorum. “ Their children,” i,e. those of the Aedni. Eorum is here used although referring to the subject of the main verb of the oratio obliqua, because the dependent clause (ut— debuerint) in which eorum comes is a consecutive clause. See note on Se and Suus, II. note, expugnari. * ‘ Taken by assault ”debuerint. Dependent on historic present. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (3).
Aedui Ambarri. “The Aednan Ambarri.’* See Oeogr. Index, under “Ambarri.” Emendations of the text have been proposed : (1) to insert quo after tempore, ‘ * At the same time as the Aedui; ” (2) to omit Aedui.
depopulatis agris. Perfect participle of deponent used in passive sense. This occurs frequently with the participles of populor, ulciscor, meditor, and others. Cp. dimenso opere, II. 19, 5.
vicos. See on 5, 2. possessiones. 1 ‘ Lands. ” nihil reliqui. [8 131.]
pervenirent. [§ 152, III. (1).] See on 7, 4.
12.
quod. Agreeing with flumen, not Arar. See on 2, 2. incredibili lenitate. [§ 115.]
in utram partem fluat. [§ 149.] transibant. Imperfect of an uncompleted action. “ Were in course of crossing.”
per exploratores. See on 3, 6; and note on Army, § 4. tres copiarum. partes. ‘ * Three-fourths. ” The rules for
expressing fractions in Latin are—
(1.) If the numerator be 1, express by the ordinal of the denominator with pars; e.g. $= pars tertia, 31, 10. (2.) If the numerator = (denominator—1), express by the cardinal of the numerator with partes; as here, j = tres partes.
(3.) In other cases express the numerator by the cardinal, the denominator by the ordinal in the feminine plural; e.g. quattuor septimae=$.
Helvetios is the subject of traduxisse. flumen. Accusative after traduxisse. Verbs compounded with a preposition implying motion to or over may lake an accusative of the place to which, or over which, the movement is made, without repeating the preposition. Cp. 31, 16 ; II. 4, 1; II. 5, 4 ; II. 10, 1. Sometimes such verbs of motion to a place take the dative. Cp. II. 10, 5.
So too verbs compounded with a preposition implying motionfrom a place may take the ablative (cp. II. 11, 1), or accusative, 44, 14.
citra flumen Ararim. I.e. on the east bank, up which Caesar appears to have marched, so that he must have crossed it lower down from the territory of the Segusiavi, who lived on the west bank. The place where the Helvetii crossed the Arar has been fixed by different editors at Chalons (Cabillonum), Mficon (Matisco), and not far above Lyons (Lugdunum).
Ararim. Notice the accusative, as if from a stem Arari-.
de tertia vigilia. See note on Army, § 10. De in expressions of time has the sense of (1) “immediately after,” e.g. de media node, II. 7, 1; or (2) “in the course of,” as here. Cp. Greek genitive vukt6s.
Eos—eorum. An awkward repetition of the object of the participle in another case, necessitated by the introduction of a new object to the main verb concidit. Cp. 54, 1, etc.
pagus Tigurinus. See Geogr. Index. Pagus was the Roman name for the local divisions of German and Celtic tribes, which the Germans themselves called “Hundreds,” according to Tacitus (Germ. 6); perhaps as originally containing a hundred households. The word “ Hundred ” is still retained as the name of an English local division. The name for the district is here used of the men belonging to it. Cp. note on 37, 3.
civitas Helvetia. Generally the name of a people is not used adjectively, but a derivative in -cus is formed from it; but there are many exceptions. Cp. 2, 2, agrum Helvetium;
14, 2, civitas Aedua; and pagus Tigurinus above.
domo. [§ 121', C. a.]
memoria. “Within the memory of.” [§ 120.]
subjugum miserat. See on 7, 4.
populo Romano intulerat. [§ 106, a.]
eodem proelio. See below on 13, 2, bello Cassiano.
13.
ut—posset. See on 7, 1, cum—nuntiatum esset.
in Arare. ilOn the A.” Cp. II. 5, 6.
id—ut flumen transirent. For use of the explanatory ut, cp. 5, 1.diebus xx. “In the course of twenty days.” See on 11, 3, omni tcmpors. [§ 120.]
intellegerent. See above, posset, section 1; and note on 7,1. legatos—cujus legationis. See 7, 3. bello Cassiano. See Historical Index, “ Longinus, L. Cassius. ” The ablative of * * time when ” [§ 120], of words which do not in themselves signify time, is often used in fixing a date; e.g. the regular Roman year*date M.'Messala, M. Pisone con• sulibus, 35, 4. Cp. eodem proelio above, in 12, 7; servili tumultu, 40, 5 ; adventu exercitus, II. 30,1 ; III. 23, 4; solis occasu, 50, 3; imperio pop. Pom., 18, 5.
egit. From agere causam, to carry on a plea at law, comes the absolute use of agere = “ to plead,” in a general sense.
eos. Sc. Helvetios. In the first part of this oratio obliqua Divico does not identify himself with the Helvetii, though he does later, as section 4, ipsos for seipsos (see on 1, 1), and section 5, sc, which in oratio recta would be nos.
sin. Probably for si-ne, the ne negativing the former alternative. “If, on the contrary (i.e. not making peace with the
), he should persist in the war,” etc.
reminisceretur. For imperative of oratio recta, see note on Exported Speech, II. (c).
incommodi. [§ 133, a.]9 Divico means the disaster of L. Cassius.
Quod—adortus esset. “Whereas—he had attacked,” or, “ as to the attack which he had made; ” quod being grammatically an accusative of kindred meaning after adortus esset.
improviso. Properly neuter ablative absolute of the participle improvisus =“it having been unforeseen.” Cp. secreto, 18, 2 ; inopinato, etc.
suae—ipsos. Suae refers to the subject of its own verb tribueret; ipsos is for seipsos, in antithesis to suae (see on 1, 1), where the se refers to the subject of the main verb of the oratio obliqua. See note on Se and Suus, II. (a).
constitissent. “Taken their stand.” internicione (inter—nex). Inter, like per, is often used
in composition to give or strengthen a meaning of destruction ; e.g. perire, interire, interimere, etc.
memoriam proderet, etc. “Transmit a record of disaster.”His. Sc. legatis.
eo—minus. [N. S. V. R p. 137.] memoria. [§ 112.] ferre. Without expressed subject (se). si alicujus. Aliquis is used for the indefinite quis after si and ne when the pronoun is emphatic =“ any whatever ” (Madvig, Lat. Or. 493, Ohs. 1). injuriae, [g 133.]
fuisse. “ It was not;” for fuit in oratio recta. deceptum. Perfect infinitive passive (esse omitted). “ But it had been deceived by the fact that it was neither conscious of any deed of its own which could cause it apprehension, and thought groundless apprehensions unworthy.” timendum. [§ 144.]
contumeliae. [§ 133, a.]
quod eo invito—quod Aeduos, etc. This repetition of a word (quod) in the place of conjunctions is called anaphora. Cp. 19, 1; 43, 4.
eo. Sc. Caesare. See 8, 2, si se invito transire conarentur. For eo in a final clause referring irregularly to the subject of the main verb (note on Se and Suus, IV.), see note on 5, 3, una cum iis.
Allobrogas. Greek accusative of a foreign word. Op. Lingonas, 26, 6; Curiosolitasy II. 34, 1; III. 7, 3. posse. See note on Reported Speech, II. (b).
victoria, [g 111.]
se—admirarentur. “Asto their wonder that they had so long carried off their wrongdoings with impunity.” Se refers to the subject of admirarentur.
This sense of impune ferre is found in Cic. Fam. XIII. 77: " Cum multos libros surripuisset nec se impune laturum putaret; ” Ov. Fasti, IV. 595, etc.
doleant—velint. The primary tenses are used here because the statement made is a general one, and therefore true in the present as well as the past. Cp. 40, 12, and 43, 8. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (4).
dentur, etc. Perhaps influenced by the tenses in the preceding section. Caesar here changes from the historic tothe speaker’s original tenses. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (4).
ipsis. Sc. Aeduis, as distinct from their socii the Ambarri, satisfaciant. “Make compensation to,” with dative. [§ 106, a.]
consuerint. In consecutive sentences (i.e. such as express a consequence) [§ 152, I. (1)] the present is used, oven after an historical tense, of actions belonging to the present, and the perfect of actions whose results continue to the present (Engl, perfect with “have”) (Roby, §§ 1515, 1516). Consuevi is a perfect with a present meaning, “ I am accustomed,” like navi, etc.
populum Romanum esse testem. Cp. 7, 4.
15.
ad numerum. Cp. 4, 2. coactum habebat. See note on II. 4, 4. qui videant. [§ 150.]
faciant. [§ 149.]
novissimum agmen. “The rearguard,” that part which appears latest to one watching an army march by.
alieno loco. [N. S. V. (?. 1, p. 137.] “On unfavourable ground. ”
sublati. ‘ ‘ Lifted up,” ‘ * emboldened. ” equitibus. See on 8, 1.
in praesentia. “At the present time j” ablative singular of substantive.
dies circiter quindecim. [§ 102 (1).] Circiter is here an adverb.
uti—interesset.	“ In such a manner that there was an
interval.” Uti expressing a consequence. [§ 152, I. 1.] quinis aut senis milibus. Ablative of comparison [§ 124 (2)]. The distributives show that this was the interval kept during each day’s march. Notice the omission of passuum. Cp. II. 30, 2.
16.
cotidie. A locative (or perhaps ablative) case of quotus dies, “as many days as there are.” Cp. postridie, meridie, etc. The interchange of qu and c in spelling of Latin words is n* BOOK I.]	Euncommon. Cp. qu/um and cum, coquus and cocusy qui and its genitive cujus, quatio and its compounds concutio, discutio. Aeduos frumentum flagitare. [§ 98.] flagitare. Histone infinitive [§ 140, 2]. Cp. below, section 3; 32, 3. The verb is frequentative in form, but no simple verb exists. [71, I.] quod essent—polliciti.	Subjunctive, dependent on
oratio obliqua, containing part of Caesar’s demand. [§ 161.] publice. “ As a state.11
septentrionibus. See on 1, 4.
frumenta. The plural, is always used in Caesar of standing crops. Cp. 40, 11; III. 9, 8.
Arare. Ablative of “ way by which ” [§ 121]. subvexerat. ‘ ‘ Brought up the river. ” Sub, with verbs of motion, implies motion to or from below.
Diem ex die ducere. “Put him off day after day.” Diem is accusative of duration of time [§ 102]. Ducere properly to protract, put off the accomplishment of a thing (38, 4); hence, by an easy change of reference, to put off a person. The object is here Caesarem (understood). Cp. se duci below (section 4). “Diem de die prospectam ” (Livy, V. 48).
conferri. By individuals bringing their contributions to the rendezvous. Comportari, of the transport of the whole amount.
militibus. [§107.]
metiri oporteret. There is a reference here to the distribution of rations of corn and fodder (memtruum, derived from memis, the distribution having been originally monthly). Metiri is probably passive here (cp. on 11, 4), as with active infinitives after oportet Caesar does not omit the accusative of the object. Cp. 23, 1.
Divitiaco et Lisco. Ablatives absolute with convocatis. [§ 125.] magistratui. [§ 106, a.]
quem—appellant. Vergobret was the name of the official, not of the office. There is a confusion of the two senses of magistratus, “ officer ” and “ office.” But the whole sentence is carelessly written; cp. the awkward series of relative clauses quorum—qui—quem—qui.
vergobretum. This title of the chief magistrate of the Aedui is derived by Mommsen from the Celtic words guerg,worker, and breth, judgment. He was elected by a council of priests (B. G. VII; 33) annually.
posset—sublevetur. See note on possit, 8, 2 ; the subject of posset is frumentum (to be supplied from the former part of the sentence).
tam necessario tempore. “At so urgent a crisis (as now), when the enemy were so near.” See on 24, 3.
non sublevetur. “He is not assisted;” opposed to sit destitutus, “abandoned.”
17.
quod tacuerat. Silere^ “ to make no noise;” tacere — “ not to speak; ” hence tacere is often used quasi-transitively, as=non-diccre. Cp. “ Quid dixit aut quid tacuit ” (Hor. Epod. V. 49); ** Aureus in medio Marie tacetur amor” (Ovid, Amores, II. 18, 36).
privatim. “ As private persons," not as holding authority from the state.
principatum Galliae. See on 3, 4.
dubitare, quin. [App. II., IV. (C.) V. (2), p. 167.]
superaverint. For future perfect subjunctive, superaturi
fuerint. See note on Reported Speech, III. (6), note (2).
Aeduis. Dative, eripere being a “ contrary ” of dare. [§ 106 (1).]
nostra. See on 1, 1. Notice that it is here used in the speech of a Gaul.
enuntiari. “ Disclosed,” the ordinary word for divulging a secret. Op. envmtiarit in the next sentence ; 30, 5; 31, 2, etc.
necessariam rem. “ A matter of urgent importance.”
18.
jactari. “Discussed.”
Quaerit, quae dixerat. “ He asks (the meaning) of that which he had said. ” Quae here does not question indirectly [§ 149], but is a relative pronoun.
Dicit. Sc. Liscus; though the change of subject is unmarked.
secreto. “Apart from Liscus,” secreto being perfect passive participle from secernere, to separate. Cp. improviso, 13, 4, etc.Ipsum esse D. “ That D. was indeed the man ” to whom Liscus had referred, summa audacia. [§ 115.] rerum novarum. See on 9, 3.
Gompluris annos. [§ 102.]
portoria—vectigalia.	Vectigal—from	veho, perhaps
meaning “that which is brought (vehitur) to the treasury”— was the general name for all the regular public revenues; portoria for one kind of vectigal, viz. the customs duties, paid on things exported and imported, parvo pretio. [§ 117.]
redempta. Redimo is a technical word meaning * * to take a contract for doing a thing ; ” here, to “ contract for the collection of the taxes,’1 “to farm the taxes.” At Borne the taxes were regularly let out to companies (societates) of publicani, who contracted to pay a sum of money to the state, and to furnish all the machinery for collecting the taxes, and received in lieu of this the actual contributions of the taxpayers, redempta habere. See note on II. 4, 1. licente—liceri. Licere, as a personal verb, means “ to be on sale ; ” liceri, “to bid at an auction sale.” Licente here is the deponent present participle, facultates. “Means.” See note on 38, 3.
numerum equitatus. “Body of cavalry.” Numerus in post-Augustan Latin became a technical word for any indefinitely large or small body of troops, domi. [§ 121, B. 6.] and [N. S. V. G. 2, p. 137]. largiter posse. “Had considerable influence.” LargUcr is a rather rare adverb from largus, for the more common large. Posse is used absolutely —potentem esse, as often with adverbs. Cp. 17, 1, plus posse, etc. homini. [§ 106 (1).] collocasse. “Given in marriage.” sororem ex matre. Sc. partdm, his half-sister, mother’s daughter.
nuptum in alias civitates collocasse. The supine nuptum [§ 141, 5] and in with the accusative are used here after collocasse, which implies motion, i.e. change from one state to another; so, “in familiam nubere ” (Cic. pro Cotl. 14). Cp. 9, 3, in matrimonium ducere. -The other construction(without motion implied) is given above, in Biturigibus collocare.
cupere Helvetiis. “ Wished well to the H.” [§ 107.] affinitatem. “Alliance by marriage,” as distinct from
propinquitas (cp. propinquas above), relationship by blood, suo nomine. “On his own account.” [§ 113.]
Si quid accidat. “If anything should happen/’ i.c. any ill. Accido is commonly of bad, contingo of good fortune, whilst evenio is neutral in sense.
spem regni obtinendi. [§§ 182,143.] On regni see 3, 4. imperio. See on 13, 2, bello Cassiano.
quod. “ Whereas. ” See 13, 4. Or it may be a pronoun
agreeing with proelium, “As to the skirmish which	”
proelium equestre adversum. In Latin a conjunction is usually put between two adjectives qualifying the same substantive; e.g. multae et graves causae— “many weighty reasons. ” But here equestre proelium make together one notion, “ a cavalry-skirmish,” which is qualified by adversum. Cp. the parallel instances in 38, 7 ; II. 18, 2; II. 29, 3 ; III. 27, 2.
paucis ante diebus. “A few days before.” Ante is adverbial, and, in sense, qualifies diebus, whence its place next to it. So paucis ante annis, III. 20, 1. Cp. paucis mensibus ante, 31, 10. For ablative [§ 120].
esset factum. The subjunctive is used in the report of the answers to Caesar’s questions (reperiebat in quaerendo), [§ 151.] auxilio Caesari. [§ 108.]
perterritum. In his account of this skirmish (15, 1, 2) Caesar rather diminishes the serious nature of the defeat. It is only here, where he wishes to show the full extent of the treachery of Dumnorix, that we learn that it ended in a panic and complete rout of the four thousand.
19.
cum—accederent. [§ 153 (1).] quod—quod, etc. For the use of the anaphora, cp. 14,
Quod—{t whereas.” See 13, 4.
quod—traduxisset, etc. These subjunctives are dependent on ora&io obliqua, as containing part of Caesar’s thought {arbitrabatur). [§ 151.]dandos curasset, etc. “ Procured an exchange of hostages. ”
injussu. An ablative of an obsolete noun. [§ 113.] “ Without his orders.” suo. I.e. Caesar’s. See note on Se and Suns, II. (5). ipsis. I.e. se et civibus. See on 1, 1. a magistratu Aed. I.e. Liscus the Vergobret. satis causae. [§ 131.]
animadverteret. [§149.] The word is contracted from animum adverteret, “ to tum one’s mind to,” “to notice.” So specially of a magistrate, animadvertere in aliquem, “ to take note of an offender for punishment,” “ to punish.”
His—rebus. [§ 106 (3).]
verebatur—ne. [App. II., IV. (A.) II. (a), p. 162.] supplicio (sub-plico). Lit. “a kneeling down,” either in entreaty, or, as here, to receive punishment. It is constantly used of capital punishment.
 prius, quam—conaretur.	[§ 152, III. (1).] See note on dum, 7, 4. For the tense, see on 7, 1, cum nuntiatum esset.
quicquam. See note on ulli, 8, 3.
cotidianis. “Ordinary,” “everyday.” See on 16, 1.
per C. Valerium Procillum. See on 3, 6.
Galliae provinciae. Galliae and provincia* are in apposition, the latter qualifying the former like an adjective. “ A leading man of provincial Gaul.” Cp. 30, 2, etc.
cui—fldem habebat. The dative cui depends on fidem habebat, which together are equivalent to a verb of trusting, confido. “In whom ho placed the utmost confidence in all matters.”
commonefacit. See note on III. 1, 2. ipso. Sc. Divitiaco.
quae—sint dicta. [§ 151.] Part of what Caesar said. So too dixerit below.
apud se. Se referring to subject of the main verb ostendit. See note on Se and Suus, II. {b).
ejus. Sc. Divitiaci [§ 127]; animi [§ 132]. ipse. Sc. Caesar, as section 2 of this chapter shows.
Petit—ut statuat. “Begs Divitiacus to allow him to
hear and adjudge the case of Dumuorix.” Ut statuat standsfor ut statuere liceat, as is common after verbs of asking. Cp. 28, 5, petentibus Aeduis ut in finibus suis (Boios) collo- carent.
causa cognita. Cognoscere in the sense of “making a legal inquiry,” “hearing a case.”
20.
ne quid. Quis, the indefinite pronoun, is seldom used except after ne, num, si, nisi.
gravius. “Too severe”=gravius justo or solito, a very common sense of the comparative. Cp. 16, 2.
plus doloris. [§ 131.]
per se. Referring to Divitiacus, the speaker. See note on Se and Suus, II. (b).
crevisset. Depends on propterea quod, the subject being Dumnorix.
nervis. “Strength,” “power.” Cp. “Nervos belli pecuniam” (Cic. Phil. V. 2, 5), “Money the sinews of war;” “ Vectigalia nervos rcipublicae ” (Cic. pro lege Manil. 7, 17).
quibus—uteretur.	Quibus is equivalent to et iis, and
thus couples uteretur to crevisset, so that it too depends on propterea quod.
ipse, Divitiacus ; eum, Caesar.
non sua voluntate. “Against his will.” futurum, uti—averterentur. For this periphrasis for the future infinitive passive, see note on Exported Speech, III. (b), note (1). And for the use of the infinitive [futurum) in a relative clause in oratio obliqua, where the relative qua—et ea, see the same note, II. (d), note (1).
cum—peteret. See note on 7, 1, and [§ 153 (1)]. rogat—faciat. The ut is often omitted after verbs of
asking. [§ 154.] * tanti. Genitive [§ 128, a.] (or rather locative—Roby, § 1187) of price, rei publicae injuriam. [§ 132.] suum dolorem. “His own resentment.” condonare. Means “to make a present to some one;” and so is used of passing over an offence as a boon to some one who intercedes for the offender.quae—reprehendat. [§ 149.]
Dumnorigi custodes ponit. “Sets people to watch Dumnorix.” Dumnorigi [§ 106 (1)]; ponit being equivalent to apponit, “ assigns to.” quae agat. [§ 149.]
21.
exploratoribus. See note on Army, § 4.
milia passuum octo consedisse ab. See note below, 22, 5.

qui cognoscerent. [§ 160.] Cognosco is regularly used of military reconnoitring.
De tertia vigilia. See note on 12, 2. legatum pro praetore. See note on Army, § 6 (6). iis ducibus. ' * Those men as guides. ”

ipsius copiae. For suae ipsius (Caesar’s forces). The antithesis is between Labienus* troops and Caesar’s. See on 1, 1.	i
Multo die. “Late in the day,” i.e. when much of it was already past Cp. III. 26, 6, multa nocte.
vidisset. Dependent sentence on oratio obliqua, being part of the report made to Caesar. [§ 151.]
sibi. Sc. Caesari. See note on Se and Suus, II. (d).
quo consuerat intervallo. “At the usual distance. ” For eo intervallo, quo {sequi) consuerat, the antecedent being included in the relative clause. For the ablative, see the next note.
milia passuum tria ab castris. Distance, where no “motion over” is implied (“space intervening” [N. S. IX. 0. c. (1), p. 146]), is expressed by either accusative, ablative, or ablative with a or ab. Where there is a verb expressing distance Caesar generally uses the accusative, except with in- tervallo and spatio.	Where there is no verb of distance he
uses accusative or ablative indifferently. See Roby, § 1087.
23.
Postridie. An old locative or ablative like cotidie, 16, 1.
metiri. See note on 16, 4.
cum—oporteret. [§ 150.] Cum here takes the subjunctive because it defines the nature of the two days’ interval
(“ An interval of two days remained, such that then	”),
and so = ut turn.
milibus passuum xviii. The usual order of numerals with milia in Caesar. See 2, 4, etc.; for ablative [§ 124].
rei frumentariae prospiciendum. [§ 107] and [§ 144, b].
Bibracte. [§101.]
per fugitivos. See on 3, 6. Fugitivi are ‘1 runaway slaves,” not “deserters,” the word for which is transfugae. Cp. 27, 3.decurionis equitum. See note on Army, § 5 (/).
quod existimarent. “By a kind of carelessness of expression the verb of saying or thinking (on which would depend the oratio obliqua) is often put in the subjunctive for the thing said or thought” (Roby, § 1746). Cp. existimarent, 27, 4 ; diceret, 39, 3.
quod—commisissent. Subjunctive because subordinate to oratio obliqua (existimarent), [§ 162, II. (1)]. It gives one of the reasons in the mind of the Helvetii for thinking the Romans were afraid of them.
eo, quod. “ Because of this, that they	Eo here is a
causal ablative [§ 111], and quite distinct from the eo magis above, which is ablative of measure. [N. S. V. E. p. 137.] confiderent. Like existimarent above, re frumentaria. [§ 123.] posse intercludi. Sc. Romanos. a novissimo agmine. “On the rear.” Cp. 1, 4.
24.
Postquam—advertit. Postquam commonly takes the perfect where in English a pluperfect would be more usual.
id animum advertit. The phrase animum advertere, “to tum one's mind,” came to be considered as containing one verbal notion “to notice,” and hence was contracted to animad- vertere, and used transitively even when uncontracted. Cp. the idiom venit mihi in mentem alicujus, where venit mihi in mentem is equivalent to reminiscor, and so takes the same case after it.
subducit — misit.	The difference in tenses marks a
difference in sense. He proceeds to lead his troops up the hill, and in the meantime sent the cavalry off. The first was a continuous action, during the progress of which the latter and instantaneous action took place.
copias—equitatum.	Notice the use of copias = “in
fantry force,” as distinct from equitatus. Cp. 48, 4. qui sustineret. [§ 150.]
triplicem aciem. See note on Army, § 7. legionum quattuor veteranarum. The four allotted
to Caesar by the senate. See note on Army, § 5 (a). supra se. I.e. he was with the veterans in the van.duas legiones, quas, etc. See 10, 8. auxilia.	)
sarcinas conferri. { See note 0D ArmJ> § 2 W-
carris. See 3, 1.
confertissima. Confertus is properly the participle of confercio, but is here and elsewhere used as an adjective. Cp. acceptus, 3, 4; exercitatissimus, 36, 7.
rejecto equitatu phalange facta. Caesar very frequently puts two ablatives absolute together without a conjunction, of which the former gives the circumstances, time, or cause of the action expressed by the latter. Here the phalanx was formed on the repulse of the cavalry. Cp. 16, 4; II. 11, 5 ; II. 12, 5, etc.
phalange. Caesar applies the Greek term <pd\ay£, which denoted any close order of battle, to that adopted by the Gauls, as Well as by the Germans (see 52, 4), in which the men crowded closely together and interlocked their shields, bo as to form a wall in front of their advancing army, whilst the weight of the dense mass of men broke through the lines of the enemy opposing their charge, cwacmcp.6s is the term used of this kind of phalanx by Plutarch. Cp, “ Cum Galli structis ante se scutis starent ” (Livy, X. 29).
sub nostram aciem. See on 16, 2, subvexerat.
25.
suo. Agrees with equo understood, from equis. omnium equis. Le. of all the mounted officers, not of
the cavalry generally.
e loco superiore. Qualifies missis. Their being on the higher ground of course increased the effect of the discharge of javelins.
Gallis—impedimento erat. [§ 108.] pluribus scutis, etc. The shields overlapping one another
one pilum would often pierce two at once, and so lock* them together.
cum—inflexisset. “Whenever the head had got bent they could not pull it out.” Cum in the sense of ** whenever ” with the subjunctive is contrary to Caesar’s general usage, but cp. III. 12, 1, cum—aestus se incitavisset.sinistra. I.e. the arm on which the shield was carried, multi ut. “So that many.” Cp. on 6, 1, vix qua. j acta to brachio. “ Swung about, ” so as to free if possible the locked shields, nudo corpore. “Defenceless,” like the Greek yvpvbs.
pedem referre. “ Give ground.”
mons suberat, etc. “There was a mountain near, at about a mile’s distance.” Oirdter is probably an adverb, and mille passuum accusative, according to rule given on 22, 6. Mille must be taken as a substantive on which passuum depends, contrary to its general adjectival use. Livy (XXI. 61) has mille equitum, and other instances occur in Caesar, Cicero, etc.
Capto monte, etc. “After they had reached the hill, and our men were advancing up it.”
hominum milibus xv. “With 16,000 men.” The ablative of manner, when the notion of accompaniment is strongly marked, requires cumf unless the noun is qualified by an attribute. Cp. omnibus copiis, II. 7, 3 ; II. 33, 2 ; pedestribus copiis, III. 11, 5.
agmen claudebant. “Closed the line of march,” “ brought up the rear.” Cp. II. 19, 3. novissimis praesidio erant. [§ 108.] ex itinere—circumvenire. “ Left their line of march, and began to outflank.” So ex itinere oppugnare, II. 6, 1 ; II. 12, 2.
aperto latere. “On the undefended flank.” [§ 121.] Caesar does not say which flank this was. Cp. II. 23, 6.
conversa signa intulerunt. “Wheeling round, charged.” Cp. II. 26, 1, and see note on Army, § 8.
bipartito. “In two divisions.” The Boii and Tulingi had hitherto taken no part in the fight, being the rearguard of the Helvetian army, but had continued their inarch. They came up in time to see the main body of their friends driven up the hill by the Romans, and at once attacked the latter on the flank nearest to them. To meet this new attack part of the Roman army wheeled round to face it, the rest repelled the renewed efforts of the half-defeated Helvetii, so that the Romans now were fighting on two fronts. See Plan, p. 29. sustineret venientes. * * Bear the brunt of the new attack.26.
ancipiti proelio. “ Twofold struggle " against two distinct attacks, rather than “doubtful struggle,” which is the common usage of anceps in this connection. Anceps is compounded of am for arribi [dfupl), and ceps, contracted for capits, the stem of caput, and so means 1 * two-headed.” For the ablative [§113].
 alteri—alteri.	“The one body,” sc. the Helvetii— “the other body,” sc. the Boii and Tulingi.
impedimenta et carros. A kind of Hendiadys, since the carri were the waggons on which the impedimenta (heavy baggage) were transported.
hoc to to proelio. * * In the course of this whole battle,” i.e. at any time during it. See on 11, 3, omni tempore.
ab hora septima. Counting from 6 a.m., when the last night-watch ended. See note on Army, § 10.
vesperum. See note on 50, 3.
cum—pugnatum sit. This is not a temporal but consecutive clause, defining hoc—proelio. “ In this battle, one in which the fighting lasted,” etc. “ The perfect is used in consecutive sentences of an event in past time simply regarded as such, without reference to its being contemporaneous or prior to other past events” (Roby, § 1516).
aversum hostem. “ The back of a foe.”
pro vallo. “Instead of a rampart.” This use of their waggons in battle was common amongst the Germans as well as the Gauls. The “laager” of the South African Boers is a similar expedient.
e loco superiore. I.e. they mounted on the top of the waggons, and threw their spears down on their assailants. So in III. 4, 2; III. 25, 1, of a real vallum.
mataras. Celtic javelins; tragulas, javelins slung with a thong, and used also by the Spaniards (B. O. V. 43).
subjiciebant. The opposite of e loco superiore conjiciebant. “ They threw—from below.”
impedimentis. [§119, a.]
captus est. Agreeing with the nearer subject in gender and number. [N. S. I. 3, ft p. 133.]
ea tota nocte. See above on hoc toto proelio, section 2.nullam partem. [§ 102.] intermisso. See below on section 6. die quarto. I.e. counting in the day of the battle; “in three days ” as we reckon.
cum—potuissent. The reason why they reached the Lingones in safety. [§ 152, I. (3).] triduum. [§ 102.]
The slaughter in this battle, which was probably fought on the plain of Cussy-la-Colonne, near Autun (Bibracte), in Burgundy, must have been enormous. According to chapter 29 the number of Helvetii, etc., at the outset of their expedition was 368,000, 92,000 being fighting men, the rest old men, women, and children. 130,000 survived the battle, so that we may infer what Plutarch tells us definitely (Life of Caesar, ch. xviii.), that at the capture of the baggage-waggons, in which the women and children were carried on the march, the slaughter by the Bomans was quite indiscriminate.
Lingonas. Cp. 14, 2.
litteras—misit, ne juvarent. A prohibition dependent on oratio obliqua [App. II., IV. (A.) II. 1, (2), p. 161], the command being implied in the litteras misit. “He sent a despatch—forbidding them to help.” qui juvissent. Dependent subjunctive in oratio obliqua, being part of what Caesar said in his despatch. [§151.] eodem loco. [N. S. V. O. p. 137.] quo Helvetios. Sc. haberet. ** And that he should look upon any who gave them help in the same light as the H.,”
t. in the light of enemies.
triduo intermisso. Intermitto has two meanings—(1) to interpose or place between ; (2) to let drop, cease from. It is used-here, and in section 4, in the former sense, i.e. three days being interposed, or, after three days’ interval; in the latter sense in section 5, itinere intermisso, the march being let drop, or intermitted. Cp. intermittere proelium, III. 5, 3.
27.
eum convenissent. Accusative after the transitive compound of an intransitive verb. [N. S. III. B. (3), p. 134.] essent. Dependent subjunctive in oratio obliqua, being part of what Caesar said. [§ 151.]postquam—pervenit. See on 24, 1. servos. Cp. 23, 2, fugitivos.
perfugissent. Subjunctive, as being part of Caesar’s demand. [§ 151.]
Dum ea conquiruntur. [§ 153 (2).] Notice caused of persons as well as things. Cp. 29, 2, quarum rerum.
pagi. See on 12, 4.
supplicio. “ Capital punishment.” See on 19, 2. ignorari. “ Unnoticed.” existimarent. See on 23, 3, quod existimarent. prima nocte. “ Early in the night.” The collection of hostages, etc., was not completed on the first day, and in the night intervening (nocte intermissa) between the first day and the second the six thousand attempted to escape.
Rhenum flnesque Germ. The conjunction que is often used to odd, not a different thing, but a new aspect of the thing already mentioned. 41 The Rhine, which forms the German frontier. ” The reason why Caesar adds fines Germ. is given in section 4 of the next chapter.
28.
resciit. .“When C. learned this.” Resciscere, “to find out some secret or unexpected occurrence.” Renuntiari is used of reports brought in by scouts, etc. See 10, 1. quorum. Placed before its antecedent his. conquirerent. The object, which is not expressed, is ‘‘the fugitives.” si—vellent. [§ 151], being part of Caesar’s order, sibi. Referring to the subject of the main verb in oratio obliqua. See note on Se and Suits, II. (b). For dative, see [§ 106, (2)].
purgati esse. “To clear themselves in his eyes.” [§ 94.]
in hostium numero habuit. “Counted as foes,” i.e. put to death.
in fines suos. Suos refers to the subject of reverti. See note on Se and Suus, I. (5).
unde erant profecti. The use of the indicative shows that this is not part of Caesar’s order {jussit), but an explanatoryremark added by the historian. Cp. patebant, 2, 4. So also with erat and incenderant below, quo—tolerarent. [§150.]
Allobrogibus imperavit, ut—facerent. Verbs of commanding govern the dative [§ 106 (4)], and are followed by ut with the subjunctive; to both which rules jubeo is an exception. See above, Helvetios jussit reverti.
copiam iis facerent. “ Supply them with. ” For dative [§ 106, (8)1 ipsos. Sc. Helvetios, etc. oppida vicosque. See on 5, 2.
ea ratione. [§ 113.]
vacare. “To be unoccupied.” Caesar wanted to keep the warlike Helvetii as a bulwark for the Province against the Germans.
bonitatem agrorum. “Fertility of the country.”
petentibus—ut collocarent. See note on 19, 4. egregia virtute—cogniti. “Known to be a people of singular courage.” The ablative is one of quality [§ 115], and esse must be supplied after cogniti erant.
Aeduis petentibus. Ablative absolute [§ 125], or perhaps dative after concessit [§ 106 (8)1 Boios depends on collocarent, so that concessit has no direct object expressed. “ He granted their request.”
postea. After the war with Vercingetorix. (B. O. VII.) parem juris, etc. “A share of civil rights and freedom equal with their own.” See note on II. 19, 2.
29.
tabulae. “Lists.” The Romans ordinarily used two thin and small boards joined by a hinge, and covered on the inner surface with wax, for writing letters, keeping accounts, and other manuscript of a temporary character. The writing was done with a pointed metal pencil [stilus). The leaves of these tabulae opened and shut like a book, so as to protect the wax surface when closed.
litteris Graecis confectae. “Made up in Greek characters.” In VI. 14 it is said that the Druids kept their accounts in Greek writing. This practice was probably borrowed from the Greek traders [mercatores) of Massilia.That a knowledge of the Greek language was not general amongst the Gauls is shown by V. 48, where Caesar relates that he wrote certain despatches in Greek in case they should be intercepted by the Nervii.
exisset. [§ 149.]
possent. [§ 150.]
et item—pueri. There is a sudden and ungrammatical change from the subordinate relative clauses (qni—qui) to a co-ordinate clause, coupled by ct. In strict grammar pueri, etc., should be genitives dependent on ratio; asjit is, a verb must be supplied to suit the sense from confecta estf e.g. conscripti sunt. “ In which list an account was drawn up of the number of those who had left their home, who were able to bear arms, and likewise the children, old men, and women (were entered) separately.”
pueri, senes mulieresque. When three or more nouns stand side by side in the same grammatical construction, they are either (1) all connected by conjunctions; or (2) none; or
-que is appended to the last, as here.
 Quarum—rerum.	Notice rerum used of persons. Caesar is thinking rather of the numerical quantities than of the persons. Cp. 27, 4.
capitum Helvetiorum. We speak in English of so many . “ head ” of cattle, but do not apply the term to human beings.
ad milia. See on 4, 2.
 Summa—fuerunt.	The verb here agrees in number with the complement instead of the subject [N. S. I. 2, p. 133]; the whole expression ad milia being equivalent to a plural nominative. See note on II. 33, 8.
domum. [§ 101.]
censu. “A calculation of the number.” The census at Borne was originally the registration of the property, rather than of the number, of citizens. It was held every five years, to determine the position of each citizen in the state, which, according to the constitution ascribed to King Servius Tullius, depended on the amount of his property.
milium c et x. According to these numbers 20,000 disappeared between the battle and the return home. (Cp. 26, 5.) Caesar only accounts for 6000, the men of the pagus Verbigenus (27, 4 ; 28,1).
BOOK I.}	F30.
totius Galliae, I.e. all Celtic Gaul, as in sections 3, 4, etc. Cp. Introduction, § 2 (4).
gratulatum. [§ 141, 5.]
Helvetiorum injuriis pop. R. “Injuries done by the H. to the Roman peopl e,” populi being an objective genitive, [§ 132]; Helvetiorum genitive of the author [§ 127].
ex usu. “ To the advantage of.”
terrae Galliae. The two genitives are in apposition. Cp. mare Oceanum, III. 7, 2 ; Oalliae provinciae, 19, 3, etc.
eo consilio. [§ 113.] florentissimis rebus. [§ 125, a.] toti Galliae. [§ 106, a.] domicilio. [§ 108.]

stipendiarias. From stipem and pendo ; lit. “those paying a sum of money;” i.e. tributaries.
Caesaris voluntate. See on 7, 3.
ex communi consensu. “With” or “according to the common consent.” The Gauls asked leave to hold a council in order to obtain the common consent of the Celtic tribes before making their appeal to Caesar.
concilio. [§ 108.] jurejurando. See on 3, 6.
enuntiaret. See on 17, 3. “Disclose the proceedings.” nisi quibus—mandatum esset. “ Except such as their common decision charged with that duty.” Quibus is dative after mandatum esset [§ 106 (2)]: mandatum esset is impersonal passive of an intransitive verb [N. S. IX. E. b. p. 144], and is in the subjunctive dependent on oratio obliqua [§ 151].
sanxerunt, ne quis. “ Forbade any one to. ” Sancio itself means “to bind,” and followed by ne, “ to bind a person (by oath or penalty) not to do a thing.”
31.
idem. Nominative plural contracted. Hdem is not found in MSS., eidem not frequently. So with iisdem and eisdem (Roby, § 378).qui ante fuerant. Sc. “with Caesar.” See 30» 1.
sibi. Referring to subject of petierunt. See note on Se and Suus, II. (b).
secreto. “ Apart from Any other audience than Caesar; ” so here = ‘ * secretly. ” See note on 18, 2.
Caesari. [§ 106, a.]
id. Explained by the ne—enuntiarentur. See on 5, 1.
dixissent. Pluperfect subjunctive in oratio obliqua for future perfect in oratio recta. See note on Reported Speech,
(6), note (2). So enuntiatum esset, below.
Galliae totius. Celtic Gaul, as in 30, 1, etc.
factiones. The regular Latin word for “political parties,”
as here. The word is derived from facere, in the sense which this has in the phrase facere ab or cum aliquo, * ‘ to side with a person. ”
Arvernos, In B. G. VI. 12, Caesar states that on his entrance into Gaul the rival states were the Aedui and Sequani: but the Sequani and Arvemi were evidently in close alliance, as is shown in section 4 of this chapter.
potentatu. A rare word, not occurring again in Caesar, and used of “political supremacy,” which was the object for which the rival states were contending.
mercede. [§ 117.]
arcesserentur. The ar for ad in composition is found in arbiter, from ad and beto, an old verb connected with Greek Patvu, pij-aofMi; and in the old Latin word arvorsum = adversum. Cp. the interchange of d and r in audio and aures. Arcesso is probably a new present formed from an old future stem in -so (like the Greek future, e.g. \v<ru) of arcio (ad-cio). Cp. the futures jusso, faxo; and the similar present forms capesso, lacesso, facesso. Cp. II. 20, 1; III. 11, 2.
copias. “Resources,” “wealth,” as in 3, 6.
feri ac barbari. Ferus is the true Latin word, equivalent to the foreign and imported word barbarus (pdppapos) in its secondary sense of “uncivilized.” Barbarus is perhaps used here in its original sense of “ speaking an unintelligible language,” “foreign.” It was probably formed to imitate the apparently unmeaning sounds of a foreign speech. Cp. ‘ 'Barbaras hie ego sum quia non intelligor ulli” (Ov. Trist. V. 10, 37).adamassent. The ad in composition here intensifies the meaning of the simple verb, “fall in love with.” Cp. ad- dubitare, *1 to have strong doubts. ”
centum et xx milium. Contrary to the usual order of words in Caesar. See on 2, 4.
clientes. “Dependent states.” See on 4, 2.
semel atque iterum. So in English, “ once and again,” “again and again.” senatum. A Roman name applied to a foreign institution. So in II. 28, 1, Caesar speaks of senatores of the Nervii They were probably the leading men of the tribe who were members of the national council.
Quibus proeliis fractos—coactos esse. For the relative pronoun followed by accusative-and-infinitive construction in oratio obliqua, see note on Reported Speech, II. {d), note (1).
pop. Rom. hospitio amicitiaque. ffospitium(vpo^eyla) was an arrangement between two states by which the members of each received hospitality from the other when they visited it. It was a less strong bond than amicitia, which was a compact by which each state engaged to adopt a friendly policy where the interests of the other were concerned, without any definite treaty of alliance (isocietas). jurejurando. See on 3, 6.
sese. Sc. the Aedui. See note on Se and Suits, II. (d). quominus. After a “verb of hindrance” [App. II., \V. (G.) V. note (1), p. 167], since recuso (re-cavtsa) means “to give reason against ” doing a thing.
se. Sc. Divitiacus. See note on Se and Suus, II. (d). qui—non potuerit. See note on 14, 6, consuerint.
Romam ad senatum. “To the senate at Rome.” See note on 54, 2.
postulatum. [§ 141, 5.]
obsidibus. The simple ablative is used here instead of the ablative of the agent with ah, because it was not the hostages, but the having given hostages that would bind him.
tertiam partem. See on 12, 2, tres copiarum partes. altera tertia parte. “A second third-part.” Harudum. Genitive dependent on the whole phrase,
milia hominum xxiv.paucis annis. “ Time within which ” [§ 120].
omnes. “ They all,” i.e. the speaker and his fellow Gauls.
futurum esse—ut pellerentur. Periphrasis for future
infinitive passive. See note on Reported Speech, III. [b), note (1).
hanc consuetudinem victus. “ This customary mode of life,” i.e. of the Gauls, as opposed to ilia, “ that of the Germans.” For	way	of	living,”	cp.	Horace,	Sait.	II.	2,
63, “ Quali igitur victu sapiens utetur?”
From here to the end of the speech Caesar changes to the primary tenses, i. e. the original tenses used by the speaker; perhaps because Divitiacus in these sections refers to the future, whilst hitherto (except in section 11, where the future sense is otherwise marked) his reference is to the past. See note on Reported Speech, III. (&), note (4).
omnia exempla cruciatusque. 11 All kinds of torture.” The que is explanatory, as in 27, 4, Rhenum finesque Germanorum. See note there, and cp. III. 3, 1, opus hibernorum munitionesque.
si qua—non. The non does not belong in sense to the si, in which case Caesar would have written nisi, but goes closely with ad nutum, “ if anything be done not at his beck or will.” Cp. 35, 4, si non impetraret, and 36, 5.
temerarium. “Hasty.”
posse. Without the subject (se) expressed. Cp. rogare, 7, 3, and note there; also dvhitare, below, section 15.
. 14. Nisi si quid. The si is superfluous to the sense, and its being kept is perhaps due to si quid being looked on as one word=aliquid.
auxilii. [§130.]
GaUis. [§144, a.]
ut emigrent. Explaining idem. See on 5, 1.
quin—sumat. [App. II., IV. (C.) V. (2),p. 167.]
. 16. Rhenum traducatur. See on 12, 2, flumen traduxisse.
Ariovisti injuria. “Wrong done by A.” [§127.] See on 30, 2.
32.
Hac oratione habita. “This’speech being delivered.”
unos. Used in the plural with Sequani, which, as thename of a people, is a word without singular, t. e. is plural in form and singular in sense. [N. E. IV. A. p. 128.] quas—facerent. [§ 151.] Subordinate to oratio obliqua, as containing part of Caesar’s thought [animadvertit). quae causa esset. [§ 149.]
 respondere—permanere.	Historical infinitives. [§140,2.] Cp. 16, 1.
quaereret—posset. [§ 153, (1).] idem. Masculine.
coram—co-oram. Compounded of cum and os (oris); literally, “ face to face,” and so used only with persons.
crudelitatem—horrerent. Horreo is often used transitively in Cicero and other authors, but only here in Caesar.
tamen. “At any rate,” “after all.” The expression is very elliptical, implying in full, “To the rest (although they might suffer much) nevertheless,” etc. Cp. 40, 5.
Sequanis. Dative with perferendi essent. [§ 144, 2.]
33.
beneficio suo. See 35, 2.
finem injuriis facturum. [§ 106, 1.] “Would put an end to his wrongdoings.”
secundum ea. “Next to, or besides, those arguments of Divitiacus.” Secundum = sequondum (see note on 16, 1, cotidie) is derived from sequor. Cp. secundo fluminei “down the stream,” the river as it were following.
putaret. [§ 149.]
cogitandam. “Ought to be taken into consideration.” fratres consanguineosque. Cp. 31, 7. So Cicero calls the Aedui fratres nostri (Fam. VII. 10). Perhaps the fiction of relationship was based on some claim by the Aedui to Trojan descent, such as the Arvemi boasted. “ Arvemique ausi Latio se fingere fratres Sanguine ab Iliaco populi ” (Lucan. Pharsalia, I. 427).
quod. The relative pronoun, and not parallel to the quod —intellegebat above.
consuescere. Consuesco, “I grow accustomed;” con- suevi, “ I am accustomed.”
sibi. Refers to the subject of the infinitive, temperaturos. See note on Se and Suus, I. (5).NOTES TO BOON L—33-34.
quin. [App. II., IV. (C.) V. (2), p. 167]; sibi temperare, “ to refrain,” being a verb of “ hindrance.”
Rhodanus divideret. I.e. the Rhone, and that only, separated them.
quam maturrime. See on 3,1. Maturrime is a superlative formed from maturus, after the analogy of prosperrimum from prosperust celerrimus from celer, etc. The regular form maturissime is more common.
spiritus. “Haughty airs;” so animi is used in like sense. Cp; Livy, XXIV. 22, “ Inflata regiis animis ac muliebri spiritu.”
34.
placuit ei ut. “He resolved to	”
qui postularent. [§ 160.]
locum medium utriusque. “A place equally distant from each of them.” Utriusque is used after the analogy of the partitive genitive with medius (cp. medium viae); the space, of which the spot chosen would be the middle point, being defined by reference to the two persons who were at either end of it. Cp. Ovid, Metam. VI. 409: “ Qui locus est medius juguli sum- mique lacerti”
colloquio. [§ 108.]
velle. The infinitive depends on a verb of saying to be supplied from postularent (e.g. et dicerent).
sese. Referring to Caesar, the logical subject of the main verb of the oratio obliqua, since placuit ei=“ he resolved.” See note on Se and Suus, III.
summis utriusque rebus. “Matters of the highest moment to both of them.”
ipsi. For sibi ipsi, as an antithesis to ille below, see on 1, 1.
si quid—opus esset. Opus est means literally “ there is work to be done,” and so is constructed—
(1) With an ablative of the instrument [§ 112], and a dative of the person to whom the work belongs [§ 107], e.g. opus est mihi gladio, “ I have work to be done with a«sword,” i.e. “I need a sword.” When the thing needed is an action the ablative of the perfect part* ciple passive is used, opus est facto. See 42* 5.(2) With a genitive in Livy and later writers; e.g. “temporis opus esse ” (Livy, XXIL. 51).
. (3) As the complement of est, the thing needed being the subject of est; e.g. “Dux nobis et auctor opus est ” (Cio. Fam. II. 6). This construction is used here and in II. 22,1. See Roby, §§ 1225, 1226. si quid—velit. The change of tense here is due to the desire of distinguishing the two forms of conditional sentence used in the passage. Ariovistus says, u If I had any need of Caesar (which I have not), I would have come to him. If he wants anything with me (as he does), he ought to come to me.” The first sentence is an instance of an unfulfilled condition, the proper tenses for which are the past subjunctive : the second sentence is an instance’ of a pure supposition, the tenses .for which are present indicatives. But the ordinary sequence of oratio obliqua would put both these in past subjunctives; to avoid the ambiguity thus arising the sequence is changed. Cp. 40, 15, sequatur.
si quid—se velit. A colloquial idiom, in which se is probably the direct object of velit; quid the accusative (cognate) denoting the extent of the action of the. verb (Roby, § 1094). Se refers to Ariovistus. See note on Se and Suus, II. (5).
commeatu. Properly of “provisions for an army” (39, 1) ; so here more generally = “preparations,” “expense.” molimento. “Effort,” “exertion,” molio=“to move a heavy body ” (moles).
quid. Not quod, for the sentence is a dependent interrogative. [§ 149.] negotii. Depends on quid [§ 130].
35.
affectus. “Although treated.” in consulatu suo. I.e. in the previous year, b.o. 59, after Ariovistus’ victory at Admagetobriga (31, 12). rex atque amicus. See note on 3, 4. gratiam referret. The plural of gratia is used in the sense of “ thanks,” with ago, the singular usually with other verbs.
ut—gravaretur. Explaining hanc gratiam. * See note on 5, 1.
venire. Dependent on gravaretur.neque—putaret. “ And declined to speak or hear a word on a subject of common concern to them.” Cognoscere literally is “to find out” (what Caesar had to say).
postularet. I.e. Caesar; the new subject is sufficiently indicated by the ah eo, which could only be used referring to Ariovistus.
8. redderet—permitteret. See note on Reported Speech,
II.
voluntate ejus. See note on 7, 8.
Si fecisset—si non impetraret. Notice the abrupt change of subject, without indication. The sense of the passage, however, makes a mistake almost impossible.
si non. The non must be taken closely with impetraret; “ if he fail in obtaining his demands.” See on 31, 12.
M. Messala, M. Pisone coss. The date of these consuls was b.c. 61.
censuisset. Censeo was the word used by senators in declaring their vote or opinion (sententia) in a debate : so here it is used of the resolution of the whole body.
Galliam provinciam. For the apposition cp. 30, 2. obtineret. Subjunctive in oratio obliqua, being a part of the senatusconsultum, which is itself dependent on oratio obliqua, as part of Caesar’s answer to Ariovistus.
quod—facere posset. “So far as he could do so;” literally “as regards that which he could do.” A regular formula in commissions.
commodo. Ablative of manner [§ 118]. See note on 7, 8. se. Repeated, after the long parenthesis quoniam—defenderet, Cp. notes on II. 25,1, and III. 22, 4.
36.
. 1. alterius. “A second person.” suum arbitrium. Suum refers to the «subject of the infinitive consume. See note on Se and Suus, I. (b).
2. suo jure uteretur. Suo here refers to the subject of uteretur; but in in suo jure, just after, to the subject of the main verb respondit. See note on Se and Suus, I. (a) and II.' (6). 8. stipendiarios. See on 30, 8.
suo adventu. I.c. Caesar’s arrival. Sibi= “for Ariovistus,” as above in section 2, and below, section 6.neque iis. Neque, “ but not,” coupling the two clauses, and not corresponding to the following neque,
injuria. [§113.]
eo, quod convenisset. ‘‘The terms which had been agreed on. ” Convenire = “ to come together, ” “ to fit; ” so “to be arranged,” or “agreed on.” si—non fecissent. See on 31, 12. fraternum nomen. ‘‘ The title of brothers. ” longe afuturum. “Would be of no avail,” “would be far from serving them.” JDecsse is commoner than abesse in this sense: but cp. “ Ne—longe tibi Juppiter absit” (Ov. Met. IV. 649); “Quo plus intererat, eo plus aberas a me” (Cic. Plane. V. 13).
Quod. “Whereas.” See on 13, 4.
sibi. Ariovistus. Se, Caesar. Secum, Ariovistus. Sua refers to neminem.
congrederetur. See note on Reported Speecht II. (c). intellecturum. Sc. eum. The subject is not expressed,

37.
eodem tempore—et. Et is much more rare than ac, atque, after words expressing similarity or difference, idem, par, alius, aeque, etc. “This message was brought to Caesar, and ambassadors came .... at one and the same time.” See on II. 19, 2.
ab Aeduis et a Treveris. The repetition of the preposition shows that they were separate embassies from the two tribes.
questum. [§ 141, 6.]
popularentur. [§ 161]. Subjunctive in oratio obliqua, as being part of the complaint.

fines eorum. Le. Aeduorum. For the irregular use of eorum referring to the main subject of oratio obliqua» see note on 5, 3.pacem Ariovisti. [§ 127.] Peace is looked on as belonging to A., being in his control.
Treveri autem. Sc. veniebant questum. pagos centum. Cp. B. G. IV. 1: Hi (se. Suebi) centum pagos habere dicuntur, ex quibus quotannis singula milia armatorum bellandi causa ex finibus educunt. Here pagos, the name of the districts, is put for their inhabitants. See note on 12, 4.
ad ripas. The plural of ripa is used here not of both banks, but of one bank and the neighbouring country. So, too, in 54, 1; II. 5, 5.
conarentur. For imperfect indicative of oratio recta; “ were trying.”
sibi. [§ 144, a.] Cp. 38, 2, sibi praecavendum. See note on Sc and Suus, II. (d). veteribus copiis. “ The forces already in Gaul.” resisti. Impersonal passive of an intransitive verb. [N, S. IX. E. b. p. 144.]

Gerundive attraction [§ 143], since the accusative of the gerund is never used with a direct object. (Roby, § 1377.)
quod. Agreeing with the predicate of est (oppidum), instead of with its antecedent. See on II. 1, 1, Belgas, quam tertiam esse partem, etc.
profecisse. “Advanced.” Cp. the meaning of proficiscor, the inceptive form from proficio, [§ 71, II.]
usui. [§108.]
facultas. Literally “easiness:” hence “power” or “opportunity,” when referred to actions; when referred to means, “abundance:” and in the plural “wealth.” Cp. 18, 3 ; II. 1, 4.
muniebatur. The imperfect here expresses a continuou8 state in past time (“ was strong ”), not a continuous action (“ was being fortified ”).
ad ducendum bellum. “ For prolonging the war ” (see on 16, 3), i.e. till the Suebi arrived.
circino. “ With a pair of compasses.”
non amplius pedum MDC. Quam is commonly omitted (without changing the construction) after amplius, plus, and minus, with numbers in expressions of distance, size, age, etc. (Roby, § 1273.) Pedum depends on spatium [§ 128]. See on 8, 1.
intermittit. ‘‘Leaves a gap” (of dry land); “does not flow.” See on 26, 6. It is here intransitive. Cp. 41, 5 ; II. 25, 1.
magna altitudine. [§ 115.]
ripae. Subject of contingant, radices being the object.
arcem. Predicate with efficit; “makes into a citadel.”
magnis nocturnis—itineribus. “Forced marches by night and day.” Here, as in 18, 6, two epithets are used without a conjunction, referring to one noun, because one of them (nocturnis) makes up one notion with the noun, “a night march.”
praesidium. “ A garrison. ”
39.
commeatus. Of military stores generally, com, fodder, etc. Cp. III. 3, 1.
moratur. [§ 153 (2).]
ex percontatione. ‘ ‘ In consequence of the questions. ”

sese. The sense of the passage shows that the pronoun refers to the Gauls only, not the traders, aciem oculorum. “ The keen glance of their eyes.” mentes animosque. “Reason and courage.”
tribunis militum, praefectis, etc. See note on Army, § 5 (rf) and (/).
alius alia causa illata. “Who, bringing forward various excuses, asked leave.” Notice that in the phrase corresponding to the English, “one bringing forward one excuse.another bringing forward another,” the Latiii only expresses the latter half, alius alia causa illata,
ad proficiscendum. Dependent on causamf not with necessariam. diceret. See note on existimarent, 23, 3. ejus voluntate. See on 7, 3.

ipsos. For se ipsosf in antithesis to Ariovistum, See on 1, 1.
ut—posset. Depends on timere, (Ut=ne non, “lest not.”) supportari. “Brought up the country.” Cp. subvexerat, 16, 2 ; see also on 40, 11.
nuntiarant. The pluperfect is used of what had occurred before, and had caused the rebuke {incusavit) in the next chapter.
castra moveri ac signa ferri. “The camp to be broken up, and the standards to advance,” i.e. the soldiers who followed the standards to begin their march.
dicto audientes fore. Audiens is used, especially in the phrase dicto audiens, as an adjective, with the meaning of “obedient.” Hence the dative [§ 106 (4)].
neque signa laturos. I.e, the signiferi (see note on Army, § 8) would refuse to advance, so that the order for the army to march would be ineffectual.
40.
1. omnium ordinum centurionibus. See note on Army, § 5 (e).
eos. I.c. all the members of the oouncil, centurions being the lowest rank admitted.incusavit. “Reproached.”
ducerentur. [§ 149.]
quod—putarent. [§ 151.] Subjunctive, as containing the reason Caesar alleged for blaming them. “He blamed
them, because (he said) they thought	” ; “he blamed them
for thinking	”.
se consule. Sc referring to Caesar. See note on Se and Suus, II. (d). Cp. for the facts, 35, 2.
cur—judicaret. The subjunctive is used here (in a question in the third person in oratio obliqua) as representing a subjunctive in oratio recta (cur—judicet ?). See note on Reported Speech, II. (5), note (1).
quisquam. See note on 8, 3. The question here is equivalent to a negative, since the answer would be negative \i.e. “there is no reason why any one should decide.” officio. The duty imposed by gratitude of acting in a friendly spirit towards the Romans.
Sibi persuaderi. [N. S. IX. E. b. and c. p. 144.] repudiaturum. Erom re- and ped- (the stem of pes, “foot”); “to spurn” or “reject.”
bellum intulisset. “Had attacked them.” Caesar puts the responsibility of war on Ariovistus.
desperarent, i See note on Rcported Specch’ (i)> sua. Refers to subject of desperarent. ipsius. For sua ipsius (see 1, 1), referring to the subject of the main verb on which the oratio obliqua depends; i.e. Caesar dixit is implied in incusavit.
Factum periculum. “Trial had been made.” Periculum comes from the same root as ex-perior, peritus, and the Greek irtpas, veipdw.
ejus hostis. Sc. the Germans, not Ariovistus. For the genitive [§ 132]. memoria. See on 12, 5. meritus. [§ 94.]
cum—videbatur. A very singular use of the mood of oratio recta in the middle of a long piece of oratio obliqua. The indicative is not infrequent in dependent clauses in oratio obliqua, which contain a statement of the writer, not of the person whose speech is being reported; e.g. concesserat in III.2,1. Bat the clause cum-—videbatur is an actual part of Caesar’s speech to his soldiers. Perhaps the irregularity is due to a desire to keep the sense of cum clear; since in oratio recta, cum meaning “ at which time” is constructed with the indicative. Translate “At which time it was considered that,” etc.
servili tumultu. Ablative of “time when.” See note on bello Cassiano, 13, 2.
tumultus. A word used technically of any sudden war in Italy, e.g. an irruption of Gauls, or revolt of slaves. In such case all citizens were bound to serve, and were summoned by the signal of flags hung out from the Capitol by the magistrate appointed to command the hasty levies [exercitus tumultuarius). The reference here is to the slaves’ revolt under Spartacus, a gladiator of Capua (b.c. 73-71), who succeeded in defying the Roman armies for three years, but was finally defeated by P. Crassus, and fell in the battle. Many of the slaves who joined Spartacus were Germans taken captive by Marius in his victories over the Cimbri and Teutones. See Biographical Index.
tamen. Answers to an unexpressed quamquam, as in 32, 5, reliquis tamen.	“	Who	(although	they were Germans) yet
had the advantage of Roman military training,” i.e. had been taught the Roman drill, and the use of Roman arms in the gladiator’s training school, sublevarent. 1 * Assisted. ”
quae. Neuter plural, referring to two antecedents of different genders [§ 92, 2, a].
Ex quo—posse. See note on Reported Speech, II. (rf), note (1).
boni. Depends on quantum.	[§	131.]
inermos. (In-arma.) From a nominative inermus, less common than inermis. So exanimis and exanimus, sublimis and sublimus, are found. Caesar is referring to the rude and ineffective arms which were all that Spartacus’ slaves had at the outbreak of the revolt.
superarint. The object not expressed is to be supplied from the quitmscum above.
superarint—potuerint. The change of tenses (cp. super* assent, at the end of section 6) is made to show that the original tense of the oratio recta was a perfect, “ have overcome,” not an aorist, like superassent, “overcame.”qul. I.e. the Helvetii, who had beaten the Germans in battle, and been beaten by the Romans.
1 8. defatigatis Gallis. Ablative absolute. Ordinarily the accusative would be used as the object of the infinitive vicisse. The construction is varied here because of the distance between Gallia and vicisse; and the participles desperantes, dispersos, imply an accusative pronoun as the grammatical object of the verb. “ The Gauls being wearied out... A. conquered them.” multos menses. [§ 102 (1).]
castris—tenuisset.	“ Entrenched himself in a camp
amongst the fens.” Castris and paludibus are instrumental ablatives [§ 112].
sui potestatem fecisset. ‘‘Had given them an opportunity of approaching him.” For the genitive [§ 132, a].
Cui rationi. The relative clause precedes that of the
antecedent (hoc—posse). “ But not even A. himself hoped that Roman armies could be entrapped by tactics for which there might have been room	”
in rei frum. simulationem. “ To the pretext of the corn supply,” i.e. of the supposed difficulty of procuring it.
conferrent. “ Attribute to ” or “lay on; ” so often with culpam, causam, etc.
arroganter. From ad-rogare ; “asking more than their due;” “presumptuously.” de officio desperare—praescribere. Officio seems here used in slightly different senses with the two verbs ; implying dutifulness or diligence with desperare, and duties with praescribere.
subministrare. The sub gives the sense of supplying deficiencies, as in donsul suffectus (a consul elected to fill a vacancy), suppleo, and perhaps in supportari,} 39, 6 ; 48, 2.
frumenta. See note on 16, 2.
dicto audientes. See note on 39, 7.
Quod—dicantur. The present tense is probably intended to signify that the rumour of mutiny was still current, i.e. it is used of a present incompleted action, like traducat in 44, 12, q. v. laturi. [§ 94.]
fuerit. Perfect of a general, and therefore always present, truth. See note on 14, 4, velint.avaritiam esse convictam. Convincere aliquem, “to prove a person guilty or wrong,” is the usual construction ; but convincere aliquid alicui, “to prove a thing” (fault or crime) “ against a person,” is also found.
perpetua vita. “All through his life.” For the ablative see note on bello Cassiano, 13, 2 ; and cp. Helvetiorum hello below. Perpetuus is derived from per and the root of pateo, of an unbroken surface, whilst continuus (con-teneo) signifies regular succession. See 48, 3.
longiorem = longinquiorem, “moredistant.” Cp. Virg. Aen. IX. 63: “ Collecta fatigat edendi ex longo rabies.”
collaturus fuisset. “He had intended to defer.” Confero is rare in the sense of differo: for another meaning of the word see above, section 10.
repraesentaturum. “ Do at once; ” literally, “ to bring back to the present ” from the past or future. Cp. the mercantile use of the word= “ to pay ready money.”
de quarta vigilia. See note on 12, 2 ; note on Army,
§10.
pudor. “ Feeling of shame ” at doing a disgraceful thing; “sense of honour.”
valeret. “Were the strong ” or “ ruling motive.”
 si—sequatur.	For future indicative of oratio recta, see on velit, 34, 2.
decima legione. Caesar’s favourite legion: see II. 21,
It was already in Gaul when Caesar first came thither (7, 2). The oratorical skill of this speech is worth notice. Caesar appeals first to the reason of the men by showing the groundlessness of their fear; then to their pride in their reputation as soldiers of Home; to the confidence in himself which his career ought to inspire; and lastly, by threatening to march with only one legion he touches their sense of honour* which would not let them abandon their general to certain destruction, and at the same time secures the loyalty of his best veterans of the tenth legion by so special a mark of trust in them.
praetoriam cohortem. See note on Army, § 4.
Huic legioni—confidebat. Confido in Caesar generally is followed by a dative of a person trusted to, an ablative of a thing trusted in. E.g. confidere natura loci, III. 9, 3.
BOOK I.]	G41.
cupiditas belli gerendi. [§ 132.] innata est. “ Sprang np in them.”
princeps gratias egit. “ Was the first to thank.”
per tribunos. See note on 3, 6; note on Army, § 5 (d). quod—fecisset. Subjunctive in oratio obliqua, as being
part of what they said. [§ 151.] “They thanked him for having formed.” confirmavit. “ Affirmed. ”
egerunt cum. “Conferred with.” The officers were to be spokesmen for them with Caesar.
primorum ordinum centuriones. See note on Army,
§ 5 («). Cp. 40, 1. satisfacerent. * * Make satisfaction, ” * * apologize. ” summa belli. “ General conduct of the war.” Cp. II. 4,
7; and summa imperii, II. 23, 4.
aliis. Here in the sense of ceteris, as is not infrequent. Notice the idiom, “ in whom he placed most trust of the rest; ” like srSkepov d^ioXoydrrarov r(av irpoycyevri/tivuv (Thucyd. I. 1), “the most noticeable of all previous wars.” In English we should say “more trust than in the rest,” though Milton has imitated this usage in “ fairest of all her daughters, Eve.”
ei. Dative after fidem habere=confido. ut—duceret. Depends on exquisito, the ut being consecutive. * * He asked the route of D., with the result that he led, ”etc.
milium. Depends on circuitu. Quinquaginta is genitive after amplius, quam being omitted [N. S. V. K. 2, p. 138]. See on 38, 5.
locis apertis. [§ 121.] This gives the reason of the circuitous march, i.e. to avoid the difficulties of the direct road to the Rhine down the valley of the Doubs, by making a circuit which would skirt the north end of the Jura range, probably by way of Vesoul and Belfort. See Map, p. 20.
intermitteret. See notes on 26, 6; 38, 5. exploratoribus. See note on Army, § 4.
milibus passuum. See note on 22, 5. Napoleon places Caesar’s camp at Cemay, a town of Upper Alsace, at the foot of the Vosges; and that of Ariovistus near Colmar, lying northeast of Cernay. Between them is the plain of Cemay, wateredby the III, a tribatary of the Rhine, and its own tributary the Thur. See Map, p. 45.
42.
quod. “Whereas.” See on 13, 4. postulasset. [§ 151.] The subject (Caesar) is omitted, per se Cleri licere. “Could be done as far as he was
concerned.”
facere posse. “That he can do itthe subject being the same as that of existimare, is not repeated.
ad sanitatem. “To his senses.”
denegasset. [§ 151]. Subjunctive, as being part of Caesaris thought.
ultro. 11 Unasked.” The word is used in its original meaning, “to a place beyond,” in section 4: thence comes its secondary meaning of going beyond what is required, i.e. doing a thing voluntarily.
pro. “In view of,” or “in return for.”
fore uti desisteret. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (1).
colloquio. [§ 108.]
ultro citroque. “Thither and hither;” “to and fro” between the two generals, vereri—ne. [App. II., IV. A. II. 2 (1, a), p. 162.] veniret. See note on Reported Speech, II. (c). alia ratione. [§ 114.]
causa. “Pretext,” as in 39,3. Caesar did not wish to afford A. any pretext for throwing up the project of a conference.
Gallorum equitatui. Caesar had no Roman cavalry. See 15, 1. equitibus. [§ 106 (3).]
eo. The adverb used for the fuller expression in eos, as in 51, 3.
legionarios milites. See note on Army, § 2. cui confidebat. See on 40, 15. si quid opus facto. See note on 34, 2.
non irridicule. “Not without humour,” “humorously.” An instance of the figure called litotes, in which an affirmation is made in the form of a denial of the opposite. Cp.14, 5, faleas non absimili forma muralium falcium. So “ illaudati Busiridis aras” (Yirg. O. III. 5). cohortis praetoriae. See 40, 15. ad equum rescribere. The joke lay in the double meaning of this phrase: (1) “to enrol afresh amongst the cavalry(2) “to enter in the class of the knights.”
The equites were originally the cavalry soldiers of the Roman citizen-army. According to the arrangement attributed to Servius Tullius they formed the highest class in the state after the senators. Some received their horses at the public cost (hence the phrase rescribere ad equum, “ to enrol for a horse”); some served on horses of their own. But by a law of C. Gracchus all persons possessing the requisite property-qualification were enrolled in the ordo equestris irrespective of service in the army ; so that from this date (b.c. 123) the name equites is applied in two distinct senses, military and civil; and the Equestrian order became the great middle class in Roman society, in which most of the merchants, financiers, etc., were found.
43.
satis grandis. “Of a moderate size.” Satis means “up to the averageso in French “assez grand” in exactly the same way (assez—ad satis).
aequo spatio aberat. See note on 22, 5; and cp. passibus ducentis, and pari intervallo, just below, section 2.
ut ex equis—colloquerentur. “ That they should converse on horseback.” So ex equo pugnare. The ex expresses the place from which the action, fighting or talking, comes. See on 4, 1, ex vinclis dicere.
initio. Ablative of place without preposition. Other phrases in which the omission is allowable are given in [N. S. Y. G. 1, p. 137].
quod—appellatus esset, etc. These quod clauses explain what the beneficia were. Cp. 35,2. For the subjunctive [§ 151].
quod—quod. For the repetition of a word instead of conjunctions (anaphora), cp. 14, 2.
quam rem—contigisse—docebat. Quam rem is subject of contigisse, quam being equivalent to et earn. Cp. 40, 0, ex quo judicari posse; and note on Reported Spbech, II. (d), note (1),paucis hominum. [§ 130.]
aditum. In law meant right of way to one’s own held through another’s. So here generally “right of access.”
sua. See note on Se and Suus, II. (d).
ipsis. For sibi ipsis, in slight antithesis to Aeduis. See on 1, 1.
necessitudinis. “ Alliance,” whether of blood or friendship. So the adjective necessarii (avayKaioi) = kinsmen, intercederent. 1 * Existed between. ”
senatusconsulta. The technical expression for decrees of the senate, as distinct from a vote of the popular assembly, plebiscitum.
ut. “How.”
omni tempore. = Semper. See note on 11, 3. principatum. “Leadership.” But see on 31, 4. nostram. I.e. Romanorum. See note on Reported Speech,

quis—posset ? For oratio recta, quis—possit ? See on 40, 3, cur—judicaret 1
in mandatis. “ By way of instructions, ” not “amongst their instructions; ” for these were all he gave. See 35, 3.
redderet. Soe note on Reported Speech, II. (c). at. “At any rate.” For this use of at in the apodosis [N. S., p. 164, note] of a conditional sentence, cp. Cic. Phil. II. 44: “ Quod si se ipsos—c conspectu nostro abstulerant, at exemplum facti reliquerunt.”
44.
ipsis. Sc. Gallis. It maybe translated “ by their own act,” ipse often having the force of ultro. Cp. Virg. Eel. IV. 21: *‘Ipsae lacte domum referent distenta capellae ubera."
ipsorum voluntate. See note on 7, 8. The Gauls state the facts differently in 31, 10-13.
jure belli. [§118.]
consuerint. A perfect-present (like novi) used of a general truth. See on 14, 4. But in all the first part of this reportedspeech (sections 2-14), and again in sections 19-21, Caesar uses the original tenses of the speaker. See note on Reported Speech ,
note (4).
decertare. “ Fight it out.” So debellare, “to subdue
utterly.”	The sense of the de is “ to the end,” “ down to the
dregs. ”
ornamento, etc. [§ 108.]
detrimento. “Loss” or “injury.” Lit. the loss of wear and tear {detero).
id. Sc. ut amicus esset, not directly referring to amicitiam.
per. See note on 3, 6.
remittatur. “Slackened,” neglected.” For future of oratio recta, see note on Reported Speech, III. note (2).
 Quod—traducat.	“As for his bringing over.” See on 13, 4.
causa. “For the sake of;” lit. “on the ground or excuse that. ” [§ 113.] See note on 7, 3.
bellum—defenderit. The verb is used in its original sense of “strike down from,” with the thing warded off as direct object; of defensive, not offensive, war. The derived sense, “to protect,” is more common with accusative of the thing protected.
Galliae provinciae. See on 30, 2.
fines egressum. See note on 12, 2, flwnen traduxisse.
sibi. Referring to the subject of its own verb (vellet): suas to the subject of the main verb of the oratio obliqua. See note on Se and Sums, I. (a), and II. (b).
vellet—veniret.	See note on Reported Speech,	II. (5);
and notice the sudden change—apparently for change’s sake— to the historical tenses. See ibid. III. note (4).
nostram. See note on Reported Speech, IV.
ipsi. For sibi ipsi, in antithesis to nos, see on 1, 1.
diceret. Sc. Caesar, by an unmarked change of subject, the sense being unmistakable.
imperitum rerum. [§ 132.]
ut non. Consecutive after tom. [App. II., IV. B. I. (1),
p. 162.]
bello Allobr. proximo. For the ablative, see on 13, 2, bello Cassiano. For the historical reference see 6, 1.
bis contentionibus. “ These latter disputes. ”secum. See note on Se and Suus, II. (&).
habeat. The return to the primary tenses is perhaps for the sake of keeping the sense of habeat clear, as being a present-imperfect,. i.e. denoting an incompleted action in the present, “ is keeping.” The imperfect in oratio obliqua corresponds to the perfect (aorist) as well as the present and past- imperfect of oratio recta. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (4).
 decedat. For future of oratio recta, III. note (2).
multis sese nobilibus, etc. We have no evidence to show whether Ariovistus here spoke truth or an empty boast. But the violence of party spirit at Rome was so excessive, that the statement is not in itself improbable.
per—nuntios. See on 3, 6.
posset. If this be the right reading, it should represent possit of oratio recta, and eorum quorum should mean “people of a class whose favour,” etc. [§ 150]; but this seems unnatural, as it would make earum refer to different persons from ipsis. It seems more natural to take quorum as exactly equivalent to et eorum, in which case we should expect posse, and the correction of posset into posse is very easy, as Mr. Roby has suggested. See note on Reported Speech, II. note (1).
discessisset. The change to historic sequence is very abrupt, since the difference in the meaning of the tenses between interfecerit and discessisset is very slight, if any. Perhaps the former puts a merely supposed case, the latter a definite proposal; i.e. “Supposing I were to kill you,” compared with “ If you will go away,” and so corresponding respectively to el with the optative and ihv with the subjunctive in Greek.
quaecumque bella, etc. Ariovistus promises Caesar that if he will withdraw into the Province, he himself will undertake for him any fighting (against the Gauls) which might be necessary for its protection.
45.
in eam sententiam. Explained by (1) quare—posset; (2) ncque—paJti, neque judicare ; “to show why he could not— and that,” etc.
quare—posset. [§ 149.}
quibus—ignovisset. [§ 107.]in provinciam redegisset. Supply an object (quos) from the quibus above; the dative is again required as remoter object [§ 106 (1)] after imposuisset.	“	Had	reduced	to	the con
dition of a province,” i.e. of subjects of Rome.
Quodsi—voluisset. An answer to Ariovistus* claim of priority in Gaul, section 14 of the preceding chapter. The Romans had conquered two Gallic tribes in b.c. 121, and so had had the right of war to annex them; but they had judged it best to leave the Gauls free, and therefore opposed any attack on their liberty by others.
antiquissimum quodque tempus. “ The claim of priority ” which Ariovistus had made. See 44, 14. suis legibus. See note on Se and Suus, I. (b).
46.
% Dum—geruntur. [§ 153 (2).]
propius tumulum. See note on 1, 3, proximi Germanis.
facit—recepit. The present expresses the abruptness of his breaking off from the conference.
ne quod—telum. Quod is here an indefinite adjective after be, distinct from the indefinite pronoun quid.
etsi—videbat. [§ 152, III. (2).] committendum. “ Occasion ought to be given.”
per fidem—circumventos. “ Entrapped through their trust in his promise. ”
elatum. “Spread abroad.” qua—interdixisset. [§ 149.]
omni Gallia. Ablative after a verb of prohibiting. [§ 123.]
Romanis. [§ 106, a.]
diremisset. Dirimo = disimo, compounded from dis and emo (to take). Cp. diribitor from dis-habeo, and scro = seso. See on 3, 1.
47.
Biduo. [§120.]
inter eos. For nos of oratio recta, and therefore deviating from the strict rule which requires sc. See on 5, 3. But the reason is no doubt that the sc plural wonld have been awkward after the se singular (= Ariovistum) before.coeptae essent. The deponent perfect of coepi is generally used with passive infinitives. Cp. II. 6, 2.
uti—constitueret. Depends on the verb of asking, to be understood with legatos mittit. “ He sends ambassadors to say ” (with infinitive, se velle),—and “ to ask {uti).” colloquio. [§ 108.]
suis. I. e. Caesar's. Se, i.e. Ariovistus. See note on Se and Suus, I. (a), and II. (a).
causa. I.e. sufficient reason.
pridie ejus diei. See 16, 1. Pridie may be qualified like any other noun by a genitive. [§ 126.] retineri—quin.	[App. II., IV. C. V., note 2 (2), p.
167.
Legatum. An “envoy” here J not a legatus in the military sense. The bracketed legatis in section 1 is probably an interpolation due to misapprehension of the meaning of legatum here.
e suis. I.e. a Roman.
feris. “ Uncivilized ” (see on 31, 6), and therefore without respect for the rules of civilized warfare, the sanctity of a flag of truce, etc.
summa virtute. [§ 116.] humanitate. “Accomplishments.” See on 1, 3. civitate* The Roman franchise; lit “ the being a civis. ”
The civitas conferred the political privileges of voting in the assemblies and at elections, and of candidature for public office ; and the private rights of intermarriage and trading with Romans, inheriting and holding property according to Roman law, and the like. The cives also were (at this time) exempt from direct taxation.
linguae Gallicae. I.e. Celtic.
qua multa—utebatur.	“Which A. used largely.”
Adjectives are often found in Latin where English would use an adverb qualifying the verb. Cp. “ in agmine multus adesse ” (Sall. Jug. 96), where multus = saepe; “Philotimus nullus venit” (Cic. Att. II. 24), where nullus = non.
longinqua. Ordinarily used of distance, here of time. See on 40, 14, for the converse use of longus = longinquus.
in eo. “ In his case.” Cp. “ Talis in hoste fuit Priamo ” (Viro. Atn. II. 641).auxiliorum. See note on Army, § 3. castra majora. I. e. the first camp, north of Ariovistus. See Map, p. 45.
50.
instituto suo. [§ 113.] See on 7, 3, ejus voltmtcUe.
meridiem. Probably for medidiem, from medius and dies ; for change of d to r, cp. arbiter from ad-beto, arcesso for ad-ccsso. See note on 31, 4.
quae—oppugnaret. [§ 150.]
vesperum. Vesper is a word of two declensions, with genitives vesperis and vesperi. In classical prose the ablatives vesperi, vespere (the former perhaps a locative), and accusative vesperum, are most common.
Solis occasu. [§ 120.] See on 13, 2, bello Cassiano.
proelio. [§113.] Without epithet, being loosely regarded as an instrument See on 7, 3, ejus voluntate.
decertaret. [§ 149.]
quod. “Whereas,” with subjunctive, because in oratio obliqua [§ 151].
ea—ut. See on 5, 1.
sortibus. Tacitus describes this mode of divination (Germ. 10). Slips cut from a fruit-tree, and inscribed with mystic words, were shaken together on a white cloth, and the omen was drawn from the words on the first three taken up haphazard by the priest, or (according to Tacitus) the paterfamiliae. The German word Loos (a lot), according to Kraner, means etymologically a twig broken from the tree: so, perhaps, k\i)pos in Greek, from K\du (break), compared with kXdbos, a branch.
utrum—necne. [N. S. IX. B. b, p. 142.]
esset. [§ 149.]
non esse fas. Fas here is in its proper religious sense — “the will of the gods,” as distinct from jus, human law. Cp. “Fas etjura sinunt” (Virg. Georg. I. 269).
51.
alarios—auxilia here. See note on Army, § 3. minus valebat. “ He was less strong than he wished ” “ was weak.” ^ See note on 48, 6, si quid erat durius. multitudine militum. [§ 113.]pro. “ In proportion to. ”
ad speciem. 11 To make a show of strength.”
triplici instructa acie. See note on Army, § 7.
necessario. Adverb, originally ablative absolute of adjective, “ it being necessary.” See note on improviso, 13, 4.
generatim. “ According to tribes.” paribus intervallis. [§113.] redis—carris. See note on 3, 1.
£0. For in ea. See on 42, 5. passis manibus. “Outstretched hands.”
ne se traderent. See note on Sc and Suus, II. (a).
52.
singulis—singulos. See note on 48, 5.
legatos—quaestorem. See note on Army} § 5 (b) and (c).
a dextro cornu. See on 1, 4, ab Sequanis.
eam partem. I.c. the opposite (left) wing of the enemy, proelium commisit. I.e. gave the signal for battle, general.
itaque. For et ita, qualifying repente.
ut—non daretur. Consecutive ut after ita. [N. S. IX. A. p. 141.]
pila conj iciendi. The gerund is seldom used with a direct object except in its genitive case: in the other cases the gerundive attraction is employed, e.g. not pila conjiciendo, but pilis conjiciendis. [§ 143.]
comminus. “Hand to hand;” from cum (con) and manus. Cp. eminus, “from a distance.”
phalange facta. “Adopting the phalanx formation;” but section 5, compared with 51, 2, shews that each tribe formed a separate phalanx. See note on phalanx, 24, 3.
complures nostri milites. “Soldiers of ours in many instances,” not “many of our soldiers,” which would be expressed by the partitive genitive. Complures is thus equivalent to an adverb (identidem), like multa, in 47, 4; see note there.
qui—insilirent. [§ 150.]
et desuper vulnerarent. These words Kraner considers to be the addition of a reader, who, confusing the phalanx order with that of the testudo (see note on Army, § 9), supposed thatthe soldiers leapt on the roof of shields, and tearing them up, struck at the men beneath. But the shields formed a wall, not a root
a sinistro cornu. I. e. their own left. See section 2. premebant. Notice the change of number through the influence of the preceding words multitudine suorum.
adulescens. Added to distinguish this Crassus from his father the triumvir.
quod expeditior erat. “ Because he was less engaged,”
e. not entangled in the m$lee, and therefore better able to discern the need of reinforcing the left wing.
inter aciem. Here acies means the actual fighting; immediately below it means a division of the army, subsidio. [§ 108.]
53.
milia passuum quinque. [N. S. IX. 0, c. (2), p. 146.] Napoleon and other editors read quinquaginta, chiefly on the strength of a passage in Plutarch’s Life of Caesar, which says that the flight extended over three hundred to four hundred stadia, i.e. forty to fifty miles. But it is safer to retain quinque, which is the reading of all the MSS., and perhaps better satisfies the geographical conditions; since, if we adopt the reading quinquaginta, we must assume that the Germans did not make directly for the Rhine. Napoleon supposes that they fled down the banks of the HI, meeting the Rhine near Rheinau.
viribus. Ablative. See on 40, 15, huic confidebat.
confisi. Deponent participle [§ 81 (8), p. 67].
reppererunt. The doubling of the^ in the perfect perhaps represents the lost reduplication retained in the simple verb pario peperi. Cp. rettuli, reppuli.
equitatu. See note on 8, 1, ea legione.
domo. [§ 121, C. a.] Duxerat, “had brought with him;99 but below = “ had married.”
Procillus. See 47, 4.
trinis catenis. Trinis instead of tribus, because catenae is generally used in the plural, like our English word “ fetters.” [N. E. IV. A. p. 128.]
Quae quidem res. The quidem adds emphasis to the
quae. “ And it was this circumstance that	”provinciae Galliae. [§ 130.] For the apposition cp. 30, 2.
hospitem. See the note on the tie of hospitium between states, 31, 7. Similarly between a Roman and a foreigner, a compact of private hospitium gave each a claim on the other’s hospitality, protection, and good offices. The bond was consecrated by religious ceremony, and often hereditary.
gratulatione. “ Occasion of congratulation. ”
se praesente de se. Notice the repetition of the pronoun in two different constructions, instead of the more terse but less emphatic de sc praesente.
consultum. Impersonal.
sortibus. See on 50, 4.
eum. Sc. Caesarem. Cp. II. 14, 1.
54.
ripas. See note on 37, 3.
quos insecuti—ex iis. See note on 12, 3.
proximi Rhenum. See note on 1, 3.
una aestate. “ Time within which.” [§120.]
hiberna. See note on Army, § 10.
in hiberna in Sequanos. It is the Latin idiom to repeat the preposition or case implying “motion towards” in expressions like this. In English wo use it only once, i.e. “into winter quarters amongst the S.” Cp. 31, 9.
conventus. A Roman province was divided, for convenience of administering justice, into districts, to the chief town of each of which the proconsul or propraetor went from time to time to preside over the assize. To hold such an assize was styled agere conventus. Caesar generally used the winter months for this purpose; but his chief motive in going now into his Cisalpine province was probably that he might be nearer Rome, and so get better information of the political movements there.[A.U.C. 697.]
BOOK II.
Campaign against the Belgae. B.c. 57.
Caesar, whilst still in Cisalpine Gaul% hears that the Belgae are intending to combine against the Romans: he enrols two new legions, and marches at the head of his army to their confines.
Cum esset Caesar in citeriore Gallia, ita uti supra demonstravimus, crebri ad eum rumores afferebantur, litterisque item Labieni certior fiebat omnes Belgas, quam tertiam esse Galliae partem dixeramus, contra populum Bomanum conjurare obsidesque inter se dare. Conjurandi has esse causas: primum quod vererentur, 2 ne omni pacata Gallia ad eos exercitus noster adduceretur; deinde, quod ab nonnullis Gallis sollicitarentur, 3 partim qui, ut Germanos diutius in Gallia versari noluerant, ita populi Komani exercitum hiemare atque inveterascere in Gallia moleste ferebant, partim qui mobilitate et levitate animi novis imperiis studebant, ab 4 nonnullis etiam, quod in Gallia a potentioribus atque iis, qui ad conducendos homines facultates habebant, volgo regna occupabantur, qui minus facile eam rem imperio nostro consequi poterant.
His nuntiis litterisque commotus Caesar duas legiones in citeriore Gallia novas conscripsit et inita aestate, in interiorem Galliam qui deduceret, Quintum Pedium legatum misit. Ipse, cum primum pabuli copia esse inciperet, ad exercitum venit. Dat negotium Senonibus reliquisque Gallis, qui finitimi Belgis erant,
BOOK II.]	IIuti ea, quae apud eos gerantur, cognoscant seque de his
rebus certiorem faciant. Hi constanter omnes nuntiaverunt manus cogi, exercitum in unum locum con-
duci. Tum vero dubitandum non existimavit, quin
ad eos proficisceretur. Re frumentaria comparata castra movet diebusque circiter quindecim ad fines Belgarum pervenit.
The Remi send ambassadors to Caesar offering their alliance: they give an account of the strength and composition of the Belgic confederacy.
Eo cum de improviso celeriusque omni opinione venisset, Remi, qui proximi Galliae ex Belgis sunt, ad eum legatos Iccium et Andecumborium, primos civitatis,
miserunt, qui dicerent se suaque omnia in fidem atque in potestatem populi Romani permittere, neque cum Belgis reliquis consensisse neque contra populum Romanum con-
jurasse, paratosque esse et obsides dare et imperata facere et oppidis recipere et frumento ceterisque rebus juvare;
reliquos omnes Belgas in armis esse, Germanosque, qui
cis Rhenum incolant, sese cum his conjunxisse, tantumque esse eorum omnium furorem, ut ne Suessiones quidem, fratres consanguineosque suos, qui eodem jure et isdem legibus utantur, unum imperium t unumque magistratum cum ipsis habeant, deterrere potuerint, quin cum his consentirent.
Cum ab his quaereret, quae civitates quantaeque in armis essent et quid in bello possent, sic reperiebat: plerosque Belgas esse ortos ab Germanis Rhenumque antiquitus traductos propter loci fertilitatem ibi con-
sedisse Gallosque, qui ea loca incolerent, expulisse splos- que esse, qui patrum nostrorum memoria omni Gallia vexata Teutonos Cimbrosque intra fines suos ingredi pro-
hibuerint) qua ex re fieri, uti earum rerum memoria magnam sibi auctoritatem magnosque spiritus in re militari
sumerent. De numero eorum omnia se habere explorata Remi dicebant, propterea quod propinquitatibus affinitatibusque conjuncti, quantam quisque multitudinem incommuni Belgarum concilio ad id bellum pollicitus sit, cognoverint Plurimum inter eos Bellovacos et virtute 5 et auctoritate et hominum numero valere: hos posse conficere armata milia centum; pollicitos ex eo numero electa sexaginta, totiusque belli imperium sibi postulare. Suessiones suos esse finitimos; fines latissimos feracis- simosque agros possidere. Apud eos fuisse regem nostra etiam memoria Divitiacum, totius Galliae potentissimum, qui cum magnae partis harum regionum, tum etiam Britanniae imperium obtinuerit: nunc esse regem Galbam: ad hunc propter justitiam prudentiamque summam totius belli omnium voluntate deferri; oppida habere numero xii, polliceri milia armata quinquaginta; totidem Nervios, qui maxime feri inter ipsos habeantur 8 longissimeque absint; quindecim milia Atrebates, 9 Ambianos decem milia, Morinos xxv milia, Menapios vii milia, Caletos x milia, Veliocasses et Viromanduos totidem, Aduatucos decem et novem milia; Condrusos, 10 Eburones, Caeroesos, Paemanos, qui uno nomine Germani appellantur, arbitrari ad xl milia.
Caesar induces his allies the Aedui to make a diversion by threatening the territory of the Bellovaci, whilst he himself marches to meet the confederate army near Bibrax, a town of the Remi.
Caesar Eemos cohortatus liberaliterque oratione prosecutus omnem senatum ad se convenire principum- que liberos obsides ad se adduci jussit. Quae omnia ab his diligenter ad diem facta sunt. Ipse Divitiacum 2 Aeduum magnopere cohortatus docet, quanto opere rei publicae communisque salutis intersit manus hostium distineri, ne cum tanta multitudine uno tempore confligendum sit. Id fieri posse, si suas copias Aedui in 3 fines Bellovacorum introduxerint et eorum agros populari coeperint. His mandatis eum ab se dimittit. Post- 4 quam omnes Belgarum copias in unum locum coactas ad se venire vidit neque jam longe abesse ab iis, quos miserat, exploratoribus et ab Remis cognovit, flumenAxonam, quod est in extremis Remorum finibus, exerci-
tum traducere maturavit, atque ibi castra posuit. Quae res et latus unum castrorum ripis fluminis muniebat et post eum quae essent, tuta ab hostibus reddebat et, commeatus ab Remis reliquisque civitatibus ut sine
periculo ad eum portari possent, efficiebat. . In eo flumine pons erat. Ibi praesidium ponit et in altera parte fluminis Q. Titurium Sabinum legatum cum sex cohortibus relinquit; castra in altitudinem pedum xii vallo fossaque duodeviginti pedum munire jubet.
The Belgae assail Bibrax ; but abandon the siege on the arrival of reinforcements from Caesar, and march towards his camp on the Axona.
Ab his castris oppidum Remorum nomine Bibrax aberat milia passuum octo. Id ex itinere magno impetu Belgae oppugnare coeperunt. Aegre eo die sustentatum
est, Gallorum eadem atque Belgarum oppugnatio est haec. Ubi circumjecta multitudine hominum totis moenibus undique in murum lapides jaci coepti sunt murusque defensoribus nudatus est, testudine facta
[portas] succedunt murumque subruunt. Quod .tum facile fiebat. Nam cum tanta multitudo lapides ac tela conjicerent, in muro consistendi potestas erat nulli.
Cum finem oppugnandi nox fecisset, Iccius Remus, summa nobilitate et gratia inter suos, qui tum oppido praefuerat, unus ex iis, qui legati de pace ad Caesarem venerant, nuntium ad eum mittit: nisi subsidium sibi submittatur, sese diutius sustinere non posse.
Eo de media nocte Caesar isdem ducibus usus, qui nuntii ab Iccio venerant, Numidas et Cretas sagittarios et funditores Baleares subsidio oppidanis mittit;
quorum adventu et Remis cum spe defensionis studium propugnandi accessit, et hostibus eadem de causa spes
potiundi oppidi discessit. Itaque paulisper apud oppidum morati agrosque Remorum depopulati omnibus vicis aedificiisque, quos adire potuerant, incensis ad castra Caesaris omnibus copiis contenderunt et ab mili-A*u.c. 697.] CAESAR'S POSITION ON THE AXONA. 117
bus passuum minus duobus castra posuerunt; quae 4 castra, ut fumo atque ignibus significabatur, amplius milibus passuum octo in latitudinem patebant.
Caesar at first tries his troops against the enemy in cavalry shir* mishesy and then chooses and prepares his ground for a pitched battle.
Caesar primo et propter multitudinem hostium et propter eximiam opinionem virtutis proelio supersedere statuit; cotidie tamen equestribus proeliis, quid hostis 2 virtute posset et quid nostri auderent, periclitabatur. Ubi nostros non esse inferiores intellexit, loco pro cas- 3 tris ad aciem instruendam natura opportuno atque idoneo, quod is collis, ubi castra posita erant, paululum ex planicie editus tantum adversus in latitudinem patebat, quantum loci acies instructa occupare poterat, atque ex utraque parte lateris dejectus habebat et in fronte leniter fastigatus paulatim ad planiciem redibat, ab utroque latere ejus collis transversam fossam obduxit circiter passuum CD et ad extremas fossas castella constituit 4 ibique tormenta collocavit, ne, cum aciem instruxisset, hostes, quod tantum multitudine poterant, ab lateribus pugnantes suos circumvenire possent. Hoc facto dua- 5 bus legionibus, quas proxime conscripserat, in castris relictis, ut, si quo opus esset, subsidio duci possent, reliquas sex legiones pro castris in acie constituit.
The Belgae attempt to capture the bridge over the river in Caesar's rear, and so cut his line of communications. Being unsuccessful\ they break up their army and return to their homes y but suffer heavy loss in the retreat from the pursuit of Caesar's cavalry.
Hostes item suas copias ex castris eductas instruxerant Palus erat non magna inter nostrum atque hostium exercitum. Hanc si nostri transirent, hostes exspectabant; nostri autem, si ab illis initium transeundi fieret, ut impeditos aggrederentur, parati in armis erant. Interim proelio equestri inter duas acies contendeba'Ubi neutri transeundi initium faciunt, secundiore equitum proelio nostris Caesar suos in castra reduxit Hostes protinus ex eo loco ad flumen Axonam contenderunt, quod esse post»nostra castra demonstratum est. Ibi vadis repertis partem suarum copiarum traducere conati sunt eo consilio, ut, si possent, castellum, cui praeerat Quintus Titurius legatus, expugnarent pontemque interscinderent ; si minus potuissent, agros Remorum popularentur, qui magno nobis usui ad bellum gerendum erant, commeatuque nostros prohiberent.
Caesar certior factus ab Titurio omnem equitatum et levis armaturae Numidas, funditores sagittarios-
que pontem traducit atque ad eos contendit. Acriter in eo loco pugnatum est Hostes impeditos nostri in flumine aggressi magnum eorum numerum occiderunt:
per eorum corpora reliquos audacissime transire conan- tes multitudine telorum reppulerunt; primos, qui trans-
ierant, equitatu circumventos interfecerunt. Hostes ubi et de expugnando oppido et de flumine transeundo spem se fefellisse intellexerunt neque nostros in locum iniquiorem progredi pugnandi causa viderunt, atque ipsos res frumentaria deficere coepit, concilio convocato constituerunt optimum esse, domum suam quemque reverti et, quorum in fines primum Romani exercitum introduxissent, ad eos defendendos undique convenirent, ut potius in suis quam in alienis finibus decertarent et
domesticis copiis rei frumentariae uterentur. Ad eam sententiam cum reliquis causis haec quoque ratio eos deduxit, quod Divitiacum atque Aeduos finibus Bellovacorum appropinquare cognoverant. His persuaderi, ut diutius morarentur neque suis auxilium ferrent, non poterat.
Ea re constituta secunda vigilia magno cum strepitu ac tumultu castris egressi nullo certo ordine neque imperio, cum sibi quisque primum itineris locum peteret et domum pervenire properaret, fecerunt, ut consimilis
fugae profectio videretur. Hac re statim Caesar per speculatores cognita insidias veritus, quod, qua de causaA.u.c. 697.] OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMY. 119
discederent, nondum perspexerat, exercitum equitatum- que castris continuit. Prima luce confirmata re ab 3 exploratoribus omnem equitatum, qui novissimum agmen moraretur, praemisit. His Quintum Pedium et Lucium Aurunculeium Cottam legatos praefecit. Titum Labienum legatum cum legionibus tribus subsequi jussit. Hi 4 novissimos adorti et multa milia passuum prosecuti magnam multitudinem eorum fugientium conciderunt, cum ab extremo agmine, ad quos ventum erat, consisterent fortiter que impetum nostrorum militum sustinerent, priores, quod abesse a periculo viderentur neque 5 ulla necessitate neque imperio continerentur, exaudito clamore perturbatis ordinibus omnes in fuga sibi praesidium ponerent. Ita sine ullo periculo tantam eorum 6 multitudinem nostri interfecerunt, quantum fuit diei spatium, sub occasumque solis destiterunt seque in castra, ut erat imperatum, receperunt.
Caesar attacks the tribes of the late confederacy successively. The
Suessiones, Bellovaci, and Ambiani surrender with little
difficulty. The reputation of the Nervii makes a more
formidable resistance probable.
Postridie ejus diei Caesar, priusquam se hostes ex terrore ac fuga reciperent, in fines Suessionum, qui proximi Remis erant, exercitum duxit et magno itinere [confecto] ad oppidum Noviodunum contendit. Id ex 2 itinere oppugnare conatus, quod vacuum ab defensoribus esse audiebat, propter latitudinem fossae murique altitudinem paucis defendentibus expugnare non potuit. Castris munitis vineas agere quaeque ad oppugnandum 3 usui erant comparare coepit. Interim omnis ex fuga 4 Suessionum multitudo in oppidum proxima nocte convenit. Celeriter vineis ad oppidum actis, aggere jacto 5 turribusque constitutis magnitudine operum, quae neque viderant ante Galli neque audierant, et celeritate Romanorum permoti legatos ad Caesarem de deditione mittunt et, petentibus Remis, ut conservarentur, impetrant.
Caesar obsidibus acceptis primis civitatfipsius Galbae regis duobus filiis armisque omnibus ex oppido traditis in deditionem Suessiones accepit exercitumque in Bellovacos ducit. Qui cum se suaque omnia in oppidum Bratuspantium contulissent, atque ab eo oppido Caesar cum exercitu circiter milia passuum quinque abesset, omnes majores natu ex oppido egressi manus ad Caesarem tendere et voce significare coeperunt, sese in ejus fidem ac potestatem venire neque contra
populum Romanum armis contendere. Item, cum ad oppidum accessisset castraque ibi poneret, pueri mulieresque ex muro passis manibus suo more pacem ab Romanis petierunt.
14« Pro his Divitiacus (nam post discessum Belgarum dimissis Aeduorum copiis ad eum reverterat) facit
verba: Bellovacos omni tempore in fide atque amicitia
civitatis Aeduae fuisse: impulsos a suis principibus, qui dicerent Aeduos ab Caesare in servitutem redactos omnes indignitates contumeliasque perferre, et ab Aeduis defecisse et populo Romano bellum intulisse.
Qui ejus consilii principes fuissent, quod intellegerent, quantam calamitatem civitati intulissent, in Britanniam
profugisse. Petere non solum Bellovacos, sed etiam pro his Aeduos, ut sua clementia ac mansuetudine in eos
utatur. Quod si fecerit, Aeduorum auctoritatem apud omnes Belgas amplificaturum; quorum auxiliis atque opibus, si qua bella inciderint, sustentare consuerint.
15« Caesar honoris Divitiaci atque Aeduorum causa sese eos in fidem recepturum et conservaturum dixit; quod erat civitas magna inter Belgas auctoritate atque hominum multitudine praestabat, sexcentos obsides
poposcit. His traditis omnibusque armis ex oppido collatis ab eo loco in fines Ambianorum pervenit, qui se
suaque omnia sine mora dediderunt. Eorum fines Nervii attingebant; quorum de natura moribusque Caesar
cum quaereret, sic reperiebat: Nullum aditum esse ad eos mercatoribus; nihil pati vini reliquaruraque rerum ad luxuriam pertinentium inferri, quod iis rebus relanguescere animos [eorum] et remitti virtutem existimarent:esse homines feros magnaeque virtutis, increpitare atque 5 incusare reliquos Belgas, qui se populo Romano dedidissent patriamque virtutem projecissent: confirmare 6 sese neque legatos missuros neque ullam condicionem pacis accepturos.
News is brought io Caesar that the Nervii, with their allies the Atrebates and Viromandui, are in force on the river Sabis,
Cum per eorum fines triduum iter fecisset, inveniebat ex captivis Sabim flumen ab castris suis non amplius milia passuum x abesse: trans id flumen 2 omnes Nervios consedisse adventumque ibi Romanorum exspectare una cum Atrebatis et Viromanduis, finitimis suis (nam his utrisque persuaserant, uti eandem belli 3 fortunam experirentur); exspectari etiam ab his Adua- 4 tucorum copias atque esse in itinere: mulieres quique 5 per aetatem ad pugnam inutiles viderentur in eum locum conjecisse, quo propter paludes exercitui aditus non esset.
Some Gauls of the Belgic tribes who had surrendered convey information of Caesar's march to the Nerviif who plan a surprise. The means employed by the Nervii to impede the advance of an invader,
His rebus cognitis exploratores centurionesque praemittit qui locum idoneum castris deligant. Cum 2 ex dediticiis Belgis reliquisque Gallis complures Caesarem secuti una iter facerent, quidam ex his, ut postea ex captivis cognitum est, eorum dierum consuetudine itineris nostri exercitus perspecta nocte ad Nervios pervenerunt atque his demonstrarunt inter singulas legiones impedimentorum magnum numerum intercedere, neque esse quicquam negotii, cum prima legio in castra venisset reliquaeque legiones magnum spatium abessent, hanc sub sarcinis adoriri; qua pulsa impedimentisque 3 direptis futurum, ut reliquae contra consistere non auderent. Adjuvabat etiam eorum consilium, qui rem 4 deferebant, quod Nervii antiquitus, cum equitatu nihilpossent (neque enim ad hoc tempus ei rei student, sed quicquid possunt, pedestribus valent copiis), quo facilius finitimorum equitatum, si praedandi causa ad eos venissent, impedirent, teneris arboribus incisis atque inflexis crebrisque in latitudinem ramis enatis et rubis sentibusque interjectis effecerant, ut instar muri hae sepes munimenta praeberent, quo non modo non intrari,
sed ne perspici quidem posset. His rebus cum iter agminis nostri impediretur, non omittendum sibi consilium Nervii existimaverunt.
The van of the Roman army is attacked whilst fortifying a camp on the banks of the Sabis. The suddenness of the onset and rapid movements of the enemy prevent the Romans from forming in regular battle order.
18- Loci natura erat haec, quem locum nostri castris delegerant. Collis ab summo aequaliter declivis ad
flumen Sabim, quod supra nominavimus, vergebat. Ab eo flumine pari acclivitate collis nascebatur adversus huic et contrarius, passus circiter ducentos infimus apertus, ab superiore parte silvestris, ut non facile
introrsus perspici posset. Intra eas silvas hostes in occulto sese continebant; in aperto loco secundum flumen paucae stationes equitum videbantur. Fluminis erat altitudo circiter pedum trium.
Caesar equitatu praemisso subsequebatur omni-
bus copiis; sed ratio ordoque agminis aliter se habebat,
ac Belgae ad Nervios detulerant. Nam quod hosti appropinquabat, consuetudine sua Caesar sex legiones expeditas ducebat; post eas totius exercitus impedimenta collocarat; inde duae legiones, quae proxume conscriptae erant, totum agmen claudebant praesidioque
impedimentis erant. Equites nostri cum funditoribus sagittariisque flumen transgressi cum hostium equitatu
proelium commiserunt. Cum se illi identidem in silvas ad suos reciperent ac rursus ex silva in nostros impetum facerent, neque nostri longius, quam quem ad finem porrecta loca aperta pertinebant, cedentes insequi au-derent, interim legiones sex, quae primae venerant, opere dimenso castra munire coeperunt. Ubi prima impedi- 6 menta nostri exercitus ab iis, qui in silvis abditi latebant, visa sunt, quod tempus inter eos committendi proelii convenerat,.ut intra silvas aciem ordinesque constituerant atque ipsi sese confirmaverant, subito omnibus copiis provolaverunt impetumque in nostros equites fecerunt. His facile pulsis ac proturbatis incredibili celeritate ad 7 flumen decurrerunt, ut paene uno tempore ad silvas et in flumine et jam in manibus nostris hostes viderentur. Eadem autem celeritate adverso colle ad nostra castra 8 atque eos, qui in opere occupati erant, contenderunt.
Caesari omnia uno tempore erant agenda: vexillum proponendum, quod erat insigne, cum ad arma concurri oporteret, signum tuba dandum, ab opere revocandi milites, qui paulo longius aggeris petendi causa processerant arcessendi, acies instruenda, milites cohortandi, signum dandum. Quarum rerum magnam 2 partem temporis brevitas et successus hostium impediebat. His difficultatibus duae res erant subsidio, scientia atque 3 usus militum, quod superioribus proeliis exercitati, quid fieri oporteret, non minus commode ipsi sibi praescribere, quam ab aliis doceri poterant, et quod ab opere singiilisque legionibus singulos legatos Caesar discedere nisi munitis castris vetuerat. Hi propter propinquita- 4 tem et celeritatem hostium nihil jam Caesaris imperium exspectabant, sed per se quae videbantur administrabant.
Caesar necessariis rebus imperatis ad cohortandos milites, quam in partem fors obtulit, decucurrit et ad legionem decimam devenit. Milites non longiore 2 oratione cohortatus, quam uti suae pristinae virtutis memoriam retinerent neu perturbarentur animo hostiumque impetum fortiter sustinerent, quod non longius hostes aberant, quam quo telum adigi posset, proelii committendi signum dedit. Atque in alteram partem 3 item cohortandi causa profectus pugnantibus occurrit. Temporis tanta fuit exiguitas hostiumque tam para*ad dimicandum animus, ut non modo ad insignia accommodanda, sed etiam ad galeas induendas scutisque
tegimenta detrudenda tempus defuerit. Quam quisque ab opere in partem casu devenit quaeque prima signa conspexit, ad haec constitit, ne in quaerendis suis pugnandi tempus dimitteret.
The battle resolves itself into a series of detached conflicts with varying results. The Atrebates and Viromandui are repulsed; but the Nervii carry the Roman camp and threaten to surround the seventh and twelfth legions.
Instructo exercitu, magis ut loci natura dejectusque collis et necessitas temporis, quam ut rei militaris ratio atque ordo postulabat, cum diversis legionibus aliae alia in parte hostibus resisterent, sepibusque densissimis, ut ante demonstravimus, inteijectis prospectus impediretur, neque certa subsidia collocari neque, quid in quaque parte opus esset,, provideri neque ab uno omnia
imperia administrari poterant Itaque in tanta rerum iniquitate fortunae quoque eventus varii sequebantur.
Legionis nonae et decimae milites, ut in sinistra parte acie constiterant, pilis emissis cursu ac lassitudine exanimatos vulneribusque confectos Atrebates (nam his ea pars obvenerat) celeriter ex loco superiore in flumen compulerunt et transire conantes insecuti gladiis magnam
partem eorum impeditam interfecerunt. Ipsi transire flumen non dubitaverunt et in locum iniquum progressi rursus resistentes hostes redintegrato proelio in fugam
conjecerunt. Item alia in parte diversae duae legiones, undecima et octava, profligatis Viromanduis, quibuscum erant congressi, ex loco superiore, in ipsis fluminis ripis
proeliabantur. At totis fere a fronte et ab sinistra parte nudatis castris, cum in dextro cornu legio duodecima et non magno ab ea intervallo septima constitisset, omnes Nervii confertissimo agmine duce Boduognato, qui summam imperii tenebat, ad eum locum contende-
runt; quorum pars aperto latere legiones circumvenire, pars summum castrorum locum petere coepit.




















Eodem tempore equites nostri levisque armaturae pedites, qui cum iis una fuerant, quos primo hostium impetu pulsos dixeram, cum se in castra reciperent, adversis hostibus occurrebant ac rursus aliam in partem fugam petebant, et calones, qui ab decumana porta ac 2 summo jugo collis nostros victores flumen transisse conspexerant, praedandi causa egressi, cum respexissent et hostes in nostris castris versari vidissent, praecipites fugae sese mandabant. Simul eorum, qui cum impe- 3 dimentis veniebant, clamor fremitusque oriebatur, aliique aliam in partem perterriti ferebantur. Quibus omnibus 4 rebus permoti equites Treveri, quorum inter Gallos virtutis opinio est singularis, qui auxilii causa ab civitate ad Caesarem missi venerant, cum multitudine hostium castra compleri nostra, legiones premi et paene circumventas teneri, calones, equites, funditores, Numidas diversos dissipatosque in omnes partes fugere vidissent, desperatis nostris rebus domum contenderunt; Romanos 5 pulsos superatosque, castris impedimentisque eorum hostes potitos civitati renuntiaverunt.
Caesar's personal valour retrieves the fortune of the day. The arrival of the two legions who had formed the rearguard of the march completes the defeat of the Neivii, zuho, resisting obstinately, are almost utterly destroyed.
Caesar ab decimae legionis cohortatione ad dextrum cornu profectus, ubi suos urgeri signisque in unum locum collatis duodecimae legionis confertos milites sibi ipsos ad pugnam esse impedimento vidit, quartae cohortis omnibus centurionibus occisis signiferoque interfecto, signo amisso, reliquarum cohortium omnibus fere centurionibus aut vulneratis aut occisis, in his primipilo P. Sextio Baculo, fortissimo viro, multis gravi- busque vulneribus confecto, ut jam se sustinere non posset, reliquos esse tardiores et nonnullos ab novissimis deserto loco proelio excedere ac tela vitare, hostis neque a fronte ex inferiore loco subeuntes intermittere et ab utroque latere instare et rem esse in angusto vidit nequeullum esse subsidium, quod submitti posset, scuto ab novissimis [uni] militi detracto, quod ipse eo sine scuto venerat, in primam aciem processit centurionibusque nominatim appellatis reliquos cohortatus milites signa inferre et manipulos laxare jussit, quo facilius gladiis
uti possent. Cujus adventu spe illata militibus ac redintegrato animo, cum pro se quisque in conspectu imperatoris etiam in extremis suis rebus operam navare
, cuperet paulum hostium impetus tardatus est.
Caesar cum septimam legionem, quae juxta constiterat, item urgeri ab hoste vidisset, tribunos militum monuit, ut paulatim sese legiones conjungerent et con-
versa signa in hostes inferrent. Quo facto cum alius alii subsidium ferret, neque timerent, ne aversi ab hoste circumvenirentur, audacius resistere ac fortius pugnare
coeperunt. Interim milites legionum duarum, quae in novissimo agmine praesidio impedimentis fuerant, proelio nuntiato cursu incitato in summo colle ab
hostibus conspiciebantur, et T. Labienus castris hostium potitus et ex loco superiore, quae res in nostris castris gererentur, conspicatus decimam legionem sub-
sidio nostris misit. Qui cum ex equitum et calonum fuga, quo in loco res esset, quantoque in periculo et castra et legiones et imperator versaretur, cognovissent, nihil ad celeritatem sibi reliqui fecerunt
Horum adventu tanta rerum commutatio est facta, ut nostri etiam qui vulneribus confecti procubuissent, scutis innixi proelium redintegrarent; tum calones perterritos hostes conspicati etiam inermes armatis
occurrerunt, equites vero, ut turpitudinem fugae virtute delerent, omnibus in locis pugnarunt, quo se legionariis
militibus praeferrent. At hostes etiam in extrema spe salutis tantam virtutem praestiterunt, ut, cum primi eorum cecidissent, proximi jacentibus insisterent, atque
ex eorum corporibus pugnarent; his dejectis et coacervatis cadaveribus, qui superessent, ut ex tumulo tela in
nostros conjicerent et pila intercepta remitterent: ut non nequiquam tantae virtutis homines judicari deberetA.u.c. 697.] THE ADUA TUCI BESIEGED.

The non-combatant population of the Nervii appeal to Caesar for mercy, which is granted.
28« Hoc proelio facto et prope ad internecionem gente ac nomine Nerviorum redacto majores natu, quos una cum pueris mulieribusque in aestuaria ac paludes conjectos dixeramus, hac pugna nuntiata, cum victoribus nihil impeditum, victis nihil tutum arbitrarentur, omnium, qui supererant, consensu legatos ad Caesarem miserunt seque ei dediderunt et in commemoranda civitatis calamitate ex sexcentis ad tres senatores, ex hominum milibus lx vix ad quingentos, qui arma ferre possent, sese redactos esse dixerunt. Quos Caesar, ut 2 in miseros ac supplices usus misericordia videretur, diligentissime conservavit suisque finibus atque oppidis uti jussit et finitimis imperavit, ut ab injuria et maleficio se suosque prohiberent.
The Aduatuci retire into a strongly fortified townf which is besieged by the Romans.
29- Aduatuci, de quibus supra scripsimus, cum omnibus copiis auxilio Nerviis venirent, hac pugna nuntiata ex itinere domum reverterunt; cunctis oppidis 2 castellisque desertis sua omnia in unum oppidum egregie natura munitum contulerunt Quod cum ex 3 omnibus in circuitu partibus altissimas rupes despectusque haberet, una ex parte leniter acclivis aditus in latitudinem non amplius ducentorum pedum relinquebatur ; quem locum duplici altissimo muro munierant: tum magni ponderis saxa et praeacutas trabes in muro collocabant. Ipsi erant ex Cimbris Teutonisque prog- 4 nati, qui, cum iter in provinciam nostram atque Italiam facerent, iis impedimentis, quae secum agere ac portare non poterant, citra flumen Rhenum depositis custodiam ex suis ac praesidium sex milia hominum una relique-rant. Hi post eorum obitum multos annos a finitimis exagitati, cum alias bellum inferrent, alias illatum defenderent, consensu eorum omnium pace facta hunc sibi domicilio locum delegerunt.
Ac primo adventu exercitus nostri crebras ex oppido excursiones faciebant parvulisque proeliis cum
nostris contendebant; postea vallo passuum in circuitu xv milium crebrisque castellis circummuniti oppido
sese continebant. Ubi vineis actis aggere exstructo turrim procul constitui viderunt, primum irridere ex muro atque increpitare vocibus, quod tanta machinatio ab tanto spatio instrueretur: quibusnam manibus aut quibus viribus praesertim homines tantulae staturae (nam plerumque hominibus Grallis prae magnitudine corporum suorum brevitas nostra contemptui est) tanti, oneris turrim moturos sese confiderent i
Their offer to surrender is accepted on condition of their giving up all their arms. They agree, but trcachei'ously keep back a part of them.
Ubi vero moveri et appropinquare moenibus viderunt, nova atque inusitata specie commoti legatos ad Caesarem de pace miserunt, qui ad hunc modum
locuti: non existimare Romanos sine ope divina bellum gerere, qui tantae altitudinis machinationes tanta
celeritate promovere possent, se suaque omnia eorum
potestati permittere dixerunt. Unum petere ac deprecari : si forte pro sua clementia ac mansuetudine, quam ipsi ab aliis audirent, statuisset Aduatucos esse conser-
vandos, ne se armis despoliaret. Sibi omnes fere finitimos esse inimicos ac suae virtuti invidere; a
quibus se defendere traditis armis non possent. Sibi praestare, si in eum casum deducerentur, quamvis fortunam a populo Romano pati, quam ab his per cruciatum interfici, inter quos dominari consuessent.
Ad haec Caesar respondit: Se magis consuetudine sua quam merito eorum civitatem conservaturum, si prius, quam murum aries attigisset, se dedidissent:sed deditionis nullam esse condicionem nisi armis traditis. Se id, quod in Nerviis fecisset, facturum 2 finitimisque imperaturum, ne quam dediticiis populi Bomani injuriam inferrent. Be nuntiata ad suos, quae imperarentur, facere dixerunt. Armorum magna multitudine de muro in fossam, quae erat ante oppidum, jacta, sic ut prope summam muri aggerisque altitudinem acervi armorum adaequarent, et tamen circiter parte tertia, ut postea perspectum est, celata atque in oppido retenta portis patefactis eo die pace sunt usi
A sudden sortie is attempted from the town. The Aduatuci, after
hard fighting, arc defeated, and sold with all their property.
^ 33- Sub vesperum Caesar portas claudi militesque ex oppido exire jussit, ne quam noctu oppidani ab militibus injuriam acciperent. Illi ante inito, ut intellectum est, consilio, quod deditione facta nostros praesidia deducturos aut denique indiligentius servaturos crediderant, partim sumptis, quae retinuerant et celaverant, armis, partim scutis ex cortice factis aut viminibus intextis, quae subito, ut temporis exiguitas postulabat, pellibus induxerant, tertia vigilia, qua minime arduus ad nostras munitiones ascensus videbatur, omnibus copiis repentino ex oppido eruptionem fecerunt. Celeriter, ut ante Caesar imperarat, ignibus significatione facta ex proximis castellis eo concursum est, pugnatumque ab hostibus ita acriter est, ut a viris fortibus in extrema spe salutis iniquo loco contra eos, qui ex vallo turribusque tela jacerent, pugnari debuit, cum in una virtute omnis spes salutis consisteret. Occisis ad hominum milibus quattuor reliqui in oppidum rejecti sunt. Postridie ejus diei refractis portis, cum jam defenderet nemo, atque intromissis militibus nostris sectionem ejus oppidi universam Caesar vendidit. Ab his, qui emerant, capitum numerus ad eum relatus 7 est milium quinquaginta trium.
BOOK 11.]rentur, section 3. The words partim qui twice repeated gave the subdivision of the nonnullis Gallis above. This is a separate division parallel to it.
conducendos. Conducere is‘ ‘ to hire,’’ *1 to take into pay; ” hence conducts “mercenary soldiers,” as opposed to volunteers. Cp. the Italian condottieret derived from the same verb, facultates. “Money,” “means.” See note on I. 38, 3. regna occupabantur. See note on I. 3, 4. Occupare is “ to seize,” “ to take,” not to hold or occupy, imperio nostro. Cp. I. 18, 5, and see note on I. 13, 2.
2.
duas legiones—novas conscripsit. Novas, from its position, is evidently used as a predicate. “He enrolled anew two legions.” These fresh legions were the thirteenth and fourteenth ; with them Caesar’s army now consisted of eight legions.
inita aestate. In>eo, “to enter upon,” “to begin,” is a transitive, and so may be used personally in the passive.
deduceret. [§ 150.]
ad exercitum venit. Caesar’s army was in winter quarters among the Sequani, under the command of LabienuB.
54, 2.
quae gerantur [§ 149] cognoscant. Cognoscere is “to get to know,” “to become acquainted with;” hence it is the regular military term for “to reconnoitre.”
constanter. “Consistently.”
dubitandum quin proficisceretur. [App. II., IV.. (C.) V. 2 (2), p. 167.]
diebus quindecim. Ablative of “time within which”
[§ 120].
3.
omni opinione celerius. “ With greater speed than any one had expected. ” Caesar more commonly uses omnium opinione in this sense.
proximi Galliae. See note on I. 1, 3.
primos civitatis. [N. S. VI. C. 3, p. 139.]
qui dicerent [§ 150] se suaque omnia—permittere. Sc is here omitted as the subject to permittere, because the meaning is clear, and the repetition would be awkward. See on I. 7, 3, rogare.paratosque esse et obsides dare et imperata facere. “ They were ready both to give hostages and to carry out the orders given.”
oppidis recipere. “To receive him in their towns.”
[§ 112.]
cis Rhenum. [§ 83.] The western side of the Rhine; “ this side ” as viewed from the Roman province. Cp. 29, 4.
4, 6. incolant—utantur—habeant—potuerint quin consentirent. Throughout this reported speech, although the introductory verb is historic in tense (dicerent), Caesar, for the sake of vivid narrative (see note on Reported Speech, III. note
), uses the original tenses of the speaker. This explanation includes the historic tense consentirent, since deterrere potuimus quin consentirent is regular in the sense “ we have not been able to prevent them from agreeing (at some previous time).” Cp. Roby, § 1510.
4.
essent—possent. [§ 149.]
plerosque Belgas esse ortos ab Germanis. The question of the origin of the Belgae is one on which there is but little evidence. On the one hand we know, both from this passage in Caesar and from Tacitus’ Germania, that many of the Belgae claimed a German origin, and pointed to an ancient tradition of having occupied the country by conquest. The Treveri and Nervii distinctly claimed this origin. (Tao. Germ,
) So, too, in I. 1, 2, Caesar tells us that the Belgae differed from the Celtic Gauls in manners, customs, and laws. On the other hand, the names of many of the tribes and places among the Belgae are evidently derived from Celtic roots.
Rhenum traductos. I.e. trans Rhenum ductos. See note on I. 12, 2.
antiquitus. “From ancient time the termination -tus in Latin, as -6 tv in Greek, implying motion from. So cadi-tus, fundi-tus.
memoria. [§ 120.] See note on 1.13, 2, bello Cassiano,
solosque esse qui—prohibuerint. The perfect subjunctive prohibuerint here is used, though it follows an historic tense, reperiebat, because in a consecutive sentence (qui— “such that they”) it is describing an event in past time,simply regarded os a completed act by itself, and not considered in relation to other past acts. Cp. Roby, § 1516.
qua ex re fieri. Infinitive in a relative clause. See note on Reported Speech, II. (d), note (1).
omnia se habere explorata. The use of the verb hdbeo with the past participle is a periphrastic form, which is very closely parallel to the modem English form, “ they had carefully examined alL” It means, however, in classical Latin more than exploravisse, signifying not only that they had made the examination, but that the results were still before them. It became more frequent in later Latin, and finally superseded the old form of the perfect altogether; the modern French perfect aimai being in fact only the corruption of amatum habeo, just as ai by itself is a corruption of hdbeo, Cp.
15, 1; I. 18, 2; Madv. § 427. The Greeks used a some» what similar expression, but with the active instead of the passive participle, e.g. dripdoat (Eub. Med. 33).
propinquitatibus affinitatibusque. “Ties of neighbourhood and intermarriage.”
pollicitus sit cognoverint. Here Caesar drops from the historical dicebant into the more vivid primary tenses, which the Remi would themselves have used. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (4).
conficere. “ To bring together,” “ to collect.”
electa sexaginta. Sc. milia. “ Sixty thousand picked
men.”
nostra memoria. [§ 120.]
totius Galliae potentissimum. [N. S. YI. C. 3, p. 139.]
totidem Nervios. Sc. polliceri.
ipsos. I.e. Belgas.
qui appellantur. Notice here the indicative, which is used in the middle of an oratio obliqua. It is not really a part of the oratio obliqua, but the parenthetical explanation made by the author to his readers. Cp. 1, 3.
arbitrari. Sc. se, i.e. Remos, which is the subject to the verb. “ The Condrusi, they said, they considered to be about forty thousand.”
5.
liberaliter oratione prosecutus. “When he had addressed them in a friendly spirit. ” Prosequi, which originallymeant “ to escort a friend on the way when leaving,” came to mean “to compliment.” So laudibus prosequi, Liberaliter means strictly “as one free man should treat another.” senatum. See note on I. 31, 6.
ad diem. “At the appointed time;” as in English, “to the day.” See on I. 7, 4, ad idus,
rei publicae intersit. [§ 129; N. S. VI. B, (1), p. 138.] Cp. Roby, § 1285.

* ripis. For the use of the plural, see note on I. 37, 3. post eum quae essent. [§ 150.]
In eo flumine. “ On that river.” Cp. I. 13, 1.
in altera parte fluminis. Le. on the left bank. See Plan, p. 117.
fossa duodeviginti pedum. See on I. 8, 1. When Caesar speaks of the size of a fosse without specifying the direction of measurement, he means generally, as here, to give the breadth. Translate, “ He orders him to fortify a camp, with a rampart to the height of twelve feet, and a fosse of eighteen feet in breadth. ”
6.
milia passuum octo. See on 1. 22, 5. ex itinere. See on I. 25, 5.
sustentatum est. The impersonal participle of an intransitive verb. [N. S. IX. E, b. p. 144.] So sustinere is used intransitively in section 4.
totis moenibus. [N. S. V. O. p. 137.] Cp. latere aperto circumvenire, I. 25, 5.
jaci coepti sunt. The deponent perfeot of coepi is used generally with passive infinitives. Cp. 1. 47,1. defensoribus. [119, b.] testudine. See note on Army, § 9. portas succedunt. See note on 1.12, 2, flumen traduxisse. subruunt. “ Pull down from below,” “undermine.” The simple verb ruo is used both transitively and intransitively.

adventu. Ablative of time [§ 120]. See note on 1.13, 2, bello Cassiano.
-potiundi oppidi. Cp. III. 6, 2, potiundorum castrorum. The gerundive attraction [§ 143] is mainly used in transitive verbs; and probably this use of potior is due to an older transitive construction, traces of which are found as in Terence (Ad. 871), “ patria potitur commoda,” and elsewhere. Sallust has “ejus (sc. oppidi) potiundi" (Jug. 89). For a similar reason we find * ‘ ad perfruendas voluptates ” in Cic. de Off. I. 8, 1.
vicis aedificiisque. See note on I. 5, 2. potuerant. Pluperfect, as being past in reference to the
principal verb contenderunt. omnibus copiis. See note on I. 25, 5, hominum milibus. ab milibus passuum. See note on I. 22, 5. minus duobus. For minus (quam) ducibus. See on I. 38, 5. But, below, amplius is used with the ordinary “ablative of the thing compared ” [§ 124]. Cp. I. 15, 5.
8.
opinionem virtutis. 1 ‘.Reputation for valour. ” [§132.] proelio supersedere. Supersedeo, means to “be above

periclitabatur. “Kept making trial.” See on perica- lum faceret I. 40, 5.
Ubi nostros, etc. The site described in this section isidentified by Napoleon (History of Julius Caesar, vol. iL cli. 5) with a hill now named Mauchamp, lying between the Aisne (Axona) and its little tributary the Miette, which Caesar does not mention. (See Plan, p. 117.) The camp lay on the face of the hill fronting the Miette* and the acies was drawn out on the gentle slope before it. The N.E. and S.W. ends of the hill sink by slight undulations, but on the S.W. the marshes about the course of the Miette would protect the Roman left flank. To secure the right Caesar drew two trenches at right angles to the direction of the ridge (itransversas), one running N.W. to the Miette, the other S.E. to the Aisne, and placed a redoubt (castellum) at the end of each. These formed a barrier (obduxit) to the enemy in any attempt to outflank the right wing of the Romans. This explanation, though said to be supported by traces of the camp and fosses and redoubts discovered in excavation, is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the text, for—
Lateris dejectus is translated as meaning the slopes at
the ends of the ridge as opposed to fronte, whilst ab utroque latere is interpreted as meaning “either facer
If only the right flank of the Romans was exposed, it is
strange that Caesar should not have said so, and more than this, that he should have used the phrase a lateribus circumvenire, rather than a latere, or a latere dextro.
Kraner’s interpretation seems to fit the text better, viz. that the fOssae were drawn one on each flank back to the Aisne, the redoubts being placed at the ends away from the river. His interpretation of lateris dejectus as “precipitous” instead of “sloping sides” is hardly justified, however, by the general usage of the word.
loco opportuna. [§ 125, a.] Opportunus, from ob and portus, probably in the sense of “before or near a harbour;” and then generally “conveniently placed.” Cp. obvius, “in the way.”
adversus. J.e. “ facing the enemy; ” or, which is the same thing, “the plain.”
quantum loci. The addition of loci in the relative clause is superfluous to the sense, since tantum patebat is equivalent to tantu/m loci patebat.

eorum fugientium. " Of them whilst in flight ” cum—consisterent, etc. These words give the reason of the great slaughter. [§ 152, I. (8).] ab extremo agmine. “ On the rear.”
viderentur. [§ 151.] The subjunctive, as expressing the thought in the minds of the Belgae.
necessitate. “Compulsion.”exaudito clamore perturbatis ord. See on I. 24, 3, rejecto equitatu. ponerent. Depends on the cum in section 4. .
quantum diei spatium fuit. A rather loose way of expressing that the number of slain was only limited by the duration of daylight. “As large a number as the length of day permitted.” sub occasum solis. “Just after sunset.”
12.
Postridie ejus diei. See on I. 47, 2. priusquam—reciperent. Subjunctive, as expressing
Caesar’s purpose. [§ 152, III. (1).] proximi Remis. See on I. 1, 3. magno itinere. It was a march of about thirty miles.
ex itinere oppugnare. See on 1. 25, 5, and note on Army, § 9.
paucis defendentibus. “Although there were few to defendit.” [§125.] expugnare. * * To take by storm. ”
vineas. See note on Army, § 9.
exfuga. “After their flight.” Notice the position of the words between omnis and multitudo; though grammatically they qualify convenit, they serve also in sense to qualify the noun. “ All the S. who had fled from the battle.”
aggere jacto, etc. See note on Army, § 9. For the ablatives absolute see on 1. 24, 3, rejecto equitatu,
operum. The siege-works.
ut conservarentur. “That they might be spared.” It is perhaps best to make these words depend on petentibus, impetrant being used absolutely.
13.
primis civitatis. [§ 130.] Civitatis—civium [N. S. YI. C. 3, p. 139].
milia passuum quinque. See note on I. 22, 5. natu. [§ 116.]
in ejus fidem ac potestatem, etc. “Surrendered at discretion.” Fides expresses their reliance on his protection ; potestatem their submission to his authority.passis manibus suo more. Cp. I. 51, 3, where the same expression is used of the Germans.
14.
eum. Sc. Caesar. Cp. I. 53, 8.
omni tempore. See note on I. 11, 3. fide. As above, in 13, 2, means ‘‘protection.” civitatis Aeduae. See note on I. 12, 4, civitas Helvetia.
omnes indignitates, etc. “All kinds of ill-treatment and insult.”
Qui. The antecedent is the subject of profugisse.
sua. Emphatic: “his own (well-known) clemency.” See note on 31, 4.
mansuetudine. Derived from manus and suetus: literally “used to the hand,” i.e. “ tame,” and so “gentle.”
eos. Not sc, since the subject of petere, to which it refers, is rather Aeduos than Bellovacos.
utatur. For change of sequence see note on I. 7, 8, liceat.
amplificaturum. The subject is not expressed, being the same as that of the preceding clause, quod si fccerit.
sustentare. Either absolute, as in 6,1, or with the clause si qua bella, etc., as object.
consuerint. Sc. Acdui. For consuerunt, a present-perfect, in oratio recta.
15.
Divitiaci. [§ 132.] “ Of doing honour to D.” quod erat—poposcit. I.e. “though he accepted their surrender for Divitiacus’ sake, yet because they were one of the most powerful Belgic tribes, he required 600 hostages.”
Nullum aditum, etc. Cp. 1.1, 3. vini. [§131.]
[eorum]. The text is probably at fault here, for the sense of the passage requires hominum; and even if Caesar had meant to say “their own minds,” we should have expected to find suos, as referring to the subject of existimarent. existimarent. [§ 151.] feros. “Barbarous.” See on I. 31, 5. magnae virtutis. [§ 128.]
increpitare. “To rail against.” incusare. ‘ ‘ To upbraid. ”qui. = Quod ii, and therefore would be followed by a subjunctive in oratio recta also. [§ 150.]
16-
triduum. [§ 102 (1).] The genitive is a commoner construction. Cp. I. 38, 1.
milia passuum x. See note on I. 22, 5. amplius. For the omission of quam, see note on I. 38, 5.
Atrebatis. The name elsewhere in Caesar is Atrebates.
eandem. I.e. “the same as themselves.”
per aetatem. “On account of age.” Per is used in the sense of “ without hindrance from ; ” that which does not hinder an action being looked on as helping it, i.e. as in a way instrumental to it (Roby, § 2037). Cp. III. 9,2, per anni tempus.
conjecisse. The subject (eos) must be supplied from the ab his of the preceding sentence; as, in 15, 4, the subject of pati is supplied from the ad eos before, exercitui. “ An army. ”
17.
exploratores centurionesque. See note on Army, §§ 4, 5 (e), and 10.
qui deligant. [§150.]
dediticiis Gallis. The Suessiones, Bellovaci, and Ambiani. See 12-14.
eorum dierum—exercitus. Of the three genitives, itineris qualifies consuetudine, defining the kind of consuetudo ; eorum dierum qualifies consuetudine itineris together in the same way, “the usual march order of those days.” Cp. tridui viam, I. 38, 1. Exercitus is genitive of the possessor [§ 127], also qualifying itineris consuetudine.
impedimentorum. The heavy baggage drawn by the jumenta, as distinguished from the soldier’s pack {sarcina). See note on Army, § 6. in castra. I.e. “to the site chosen for the camp.” magnum spatium. See note on I. 22, 5.
futurum ut auderent. See note on Reported Speech, III. (5), note (1).
contra consistere. “To maintain their ground against the attack.”antiquitus. “ Traditionally.’* See note on 4, 1. quicquid possunt valent. “All their strength lies
in.” Quicquid possunt qualifies valent adverbially, just like plurimum in the common phrase plurimum posse.
incisis. Not “cut down” but “cut into,” “nicked” so as to bend more easily, in latitudinem. “To ” or “along the breadth.” interjectis. “ Placed in between.” The young trees were bent till their trunks lay in a horizontal position; the boughB springing up along the trunk formed a hedge.
instar muri. Instar is an indeclinable substantive meaning likeness, and its construction here is strictly an apposition to munimenta. But it is commonly used in the sense of an adjective, “like,” “equivalent to,” “as good as.” posset. [§ 150.]
consilium. Le. the scheme of attacking the Romans whilst on their march.
18.
Loci natura. On this description of the battlefield see Plan, p. 124.
aequaliter. “Uniformly.”
acclivitate. A slope viewed from below; declivis, in section 1, being applied to the slope of the hill viewed from the top.
adversus huic et contrarius. “ Facing this hill and opposite to it,” i.e. on the other side of the river.
passus—ducentos. See I. 22, 5.
infimus apertus. Apertus qualifies the single notion formed by infimus collis, “the bottom of the hill.” See note on I. 18, 6, proelium equestre adversum.
introrsus. Contracted from introversus. So rursus (reversus), prorsus, seorsum, quorsum.
secundum. Along”=sequondumy i.e. the accusative of the verbal noun from sequor used as a preposition. See on I. 33, 2.
stationes. “Pickets.” See note on Armyt § 10.

pedum trium. See note on I. 8, 1.19.
omnibus copiis. See note on I. 25, 5, hominum milibus.
agminis. Used here in its proper sense of “ marching line.” See note on Army, § 6.
aliter—ac. Ac and atque (more rarely ct; see on I. 37, 1) are used after adverbs and adjectives denoting nearness, identity, similarity, and the opposites of these, where we use “ than ” or “ as.” The two members of such sentences are strictly two coordinate clauses, e.g. Ego aliter sentio ac tu (aliter sentis), meaning literally “ I feel otherwise and so do you.”
hosti. See note on I. 12, 2, flumen traduxisse. consuetudine sua. [§ 113.] See on I. 7, 3, ejus
voluntate.
expeditas. See note on Armyt § 2 (d). proxime. See 2, 1.
agmen claudebant. “Brought up the rear.” praesidio. [§108.]

silvas. Different parts of the forest: silva the forest as a whole, opposed to the aperta loca.
quem ad finem. Concisely for ad eum finem ad quern,; the antecedent being taken into the relative clause.
porrecta loca aperta. Porrecta is part of the predicate; pertinebant porrecta= “ reached in extent.” opere dimenso. “The measurements for the (camp) fortifications being completed.” See note on Army, § 10. For the passive use of the deponent participle, cp. I. 11, 4, depopulatis agris.
quod tempus. Referring to ubi above=eo tempore cum.
convenerat. See note on I. 36, 5. ut—confirmaverant. “ In the order in which they had formed their ranks for battle within the woods, and as they had made up their minds to attack.” aciem ordinesque. A kind of hendiadys; “ their battle order and ranks,” for “the ranks of their battle order.** omnibus copiis. See note on I. 25, 5, hominum milibus.pulsis. “ Dislodged from their position.” proturbatis. * ‘ Driven before the advancing enemy. ”
ut paene—viderentur. “ That the enemy seemed almost at the same moment to be at the forest, in the river, and already at close quarters with us.” For this sense of manus, cp. Livy,
46, “in manus venire.”
adverso colie. [§ 125, a.] “ Up the hill; ” literally, “ the hill facing them.”
20«
Caesari. [§ 107, <2.] vexillum. See note on Army, § 8.
insigne. A substantive, as in I. 22, 1, but here in a different sense; “a signal flag:” and so distinguished from signum below, the signal given by sound of trumpet opere. /.& of fortifying the camp. Cp. III. 3, 1, etc. aggeris. The materials (earth, stone, etc.) of which the wall of the camp was built; more commonly the word is used of the wall itself.
successus. “The approach” from the lower ground (sub).
impediebat. The verb is singular, because the two subjects, brevitas temporis and successus hostium, practically express but one notion, “the shortness of the time caused by the approach of the enemy.” See note on 24, 8.
subsidio. [§ 108.]
scientia. “Technical knowledge of their duties;” usus9 “practical experience in battle.” Cp. IIL 8, 1, oporteret. [§ 149.]
ipsi sibi praescribere. “Give themselves the needful orders. * * Ipsi has here the sense of * * voluntarily, ” * * untaught. ” See on I. 44, 4. singulisque singulos. See note on I. 48, 5.
exspectabant. “ Waited for.” videbantur. “ Seemed right; ” like the Greek
21.
1. necessariis. Le. what was indispensable, and nothing else.
imperatis. Impero being transitive, as followed by an BOOK II.]	Kaccusative of the thing ordered, has in this construction a personal passive voice.
quam partem. The antecedent, in earn partem, must be supplied after decucurrit.	“	He	ran	down	the	hill	to that part
of the line which chance put in his way.” decucurrit- The reduplication is commonly dropped in compounds of verbs which have a reduplicated perfect, but is not seldom retained in compounds of curro. Cp. however 19, 7.
 quam uti suae—sustinerent.	“Than (to urge them) to hold fast the memory of their ancient deeds of valour, and not lose their presence of mind, but boldly sustain the enemy’s onset.” Que {hostiumque) couples sustinerent to uti— retinerent.

quod—aberant. These words give the reason why Caesar gave the signal for battle, quo—posset. [§ 150.]
pugnantibus occurrit. “Finds them already en-
Raged-”

22.
dejectusque collis. “ The slope of the hill,” added to explain natura loci. For this explanatory use of que, see on
27, 4.
rei mil. ratio atque ordo. “Military science and arrangement, ” = ‘'* scientific military arrangement. ” Hendiadys, as in 19, 6, aciem ordinesque.
diversis legionibus. [§ 125.] Ablative absolute, and not in the nominative with aliae (as it might have been); in order to bring out the reason of the disorder more strongly. “When, because the legions were separated (by the nature of the ground) from each other, they were fighting,” etc.
diversis. A participle here rather than an adjective. Cp. 23, 3. ante. Viz. in 17, 4.certa subsidia. “ Any definite reserves. ” The movements of the enemy were concealed, and the point of each fresh attack uncertain, so that Caesar could not tell where to place reserves, quid—opus esset. [§ 149], and see note on I. 34, 2.
in tanta rerum, etc. “Where the conditions were so unfavourable, the issues also of fortune varied. ”
23.
acie. [§ ISO.] Aciei and even acii are found as genitives of this word, but, according to Aulus Gellius, Caesar preferred the genitive in -e from words of this declension. Aul. Gell. IX. 14. Cp. Roby, § 357.
constiterant. “Had taken up their position.” Seethe Plan, p. 124.
exanimatos. Derived from ex-anvma. “ Out of breath,” “ exhausted ; ” accusative agreeing with Atrebates. ea pars. The left of the Roman line. See the Plan, p. 124. compulerunt. “Drove them altogether,” i.e. along the whole line.

Ipsi. I.e. the soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions.
diversae duae legiones. “The two legions which were separated.” Diversae, participle from diverto, as in 22,1.
quibuscum erant congressi. The nominative is milites or legionarii, to be supplied from legionis by synesis. [§ 160.] Cp. 26, 5, qui.
ex loco superiore. This goes closely with profligatis Viromanduis.
non magno intervallo. See note on I. 22, 5. confertissimo agmine. [§ 125, a.] See note on I. 24, 3.
aperto latere. “On the unprotected side,” i.e, the
right, for beyond these legions there were no other troops in that direction. See the Plan, p. 124. Cp. I. 25, 5.
24.
1. levis armaturae pedites. “The light-armed infantry.” Cp. 10, 1; and see note on Army, § 1.
dixeram. See note on 1, 1. This repulse of cavalry had been mentioned in 19, 7;adversis hostibus occurrebant. “Met the enemy right opposite them. ” As they were returning to the camp, they found the Nervii just reaching it.
calones. “ Soldiers’ servants.” See note on Army, § 4. ab decumana porta. See note on Army, § 10. summo jugo collis. I.e. the hill at the top of which the camp stood.
8. qui cum impedimentis veniebant. I e. the drivers of the baggage waggons, not the legionary soldiers, who brought up the rear; for these are mentioned later, 26, 3.
clamor fremitusque oriebatur. Here the verb is singular, because clamor frcmitusque expresses but one idea; “shouting and hubbub,” “confused shouting.” See note on 20, 2.
ferebantur. “Rushed off.”
opinio virtutis. “ Reputation for valour.” [§ 102.] diversos. Participle from diverto. “Turned in various
directions,” “scattered.” Cp. 22, 1.
desperatis. Passive participle. Desperare is often transitive (desperare salutem) as well as intransitive (desperare de salute).
castris. [§ 119, a.]
25.
A very complicated sentence, because of the long series of qualifying clauses which extends from ab decimae to sine scuto venerat. The series is to be analyzed thus :—
A participial clause qualifying Caesar; ab decimae
legionis cohortatione—profectus.
A long relatival clause extending from ubi suos urgeri
to submitti posset.
A participial clause, with a relatival clause appended,
8C1U0—detracto, quod ipse eo sine scuto venerat.
The long relatival clause (2) is further divided up into
Accusatives with infinitives depending on vidit, viz.
milites—esse impedimento, (2) reliquos esse tardiores, (3) nonnullos—excedere ac tela vitare, (4) 1 hostis neque intermittere—et instare, (5) rem esse in angusto, (6) neque ullum esse subsidium.
Ablatives absolute inserted as qualifying these infini
tives, viz. signis—collatis, qualifying (1) esse impedi-mento ; centurionibus occisis—signo amisso—Baculo confecto, qualifying (2) reliquos esse tardiores; deserto loco, qualifying (3) excedere.
But besides this, owing partly to the length of the sentence, and partly to the fact that he had omitted the conjunction (which naturally would have come before quartae), Caesar, in order to show the dependence of the infinitives reliquos esse tardiores, etc., which are separated from their governing verb vidit by the ablatives absolute, repeats the verb vidit below, although strictly it is superfluous. For a similar repetition of a word where the construction would have been grammatical without it (called epanalepsis), cp. I. 35, 4, sese—se Aeduorum injurias non neglecturum. In our English idiom a somewhat similar repetition is not uncommon. “He, when he saw—he, I say, would not.” Cp. in the English Prayer Book, “ Almighty God —He pardoneth and absolveth.” See also note on III. 22, 4.
ab decimae legionis cohortatione. Notice the use of the abstract noun where we might have expected the gerundi ve attraction. “After exhorting the tenth legion.” Cp. munitione, I. 49, 3.
signis in unum locum collatis. The standards were all collected together, and the men closely packed, because, owing to the pressure of the enemy’s attack, they were not able to maintain their proper order. See note on Army, § 7. sibi—impedimento. [§ 108.]
primipilo P. Sextio Baculo. The same man is referred to again in III. 5, 2, where he is called primi pili centurio. For the meaning of the two expressions, cp. note on Army, § 5 («).
ab novissimis. “ Towards the rear.” Cp. for this common use of ab, I. 1, 4. These words must be taken closely with excedere, not with nonnullos, “some of the rear rank,” which would require rather de or ex.
neque a fronte—intermittere et—instare.	Here
neque and et correspond to one another, “both not”—“and.” Or, as we should translate, “saw them coming up without any intermission, and at the same time pressing on them.” Intermittere is intransitive here, as in I. 38, 5; see on I. 26, 6.
quod submitti posset. [§ 150.] “Which could be sent up to the aid,” according to a common meaning of sub in compounds. See note on I. 40, 11.[uni] militi. Uni, if retained here, is used, as occasionally also in Cicero (e.g. ad Att. IX. 10, 2), in very much the same sense as our indefinite article, “a soldier.” Cp. the French derivative un, une. In late Greek cU was used in the same way. The English a, an, and one were in their original forms identical.
signa inferre et manipulos laxare. “To attack the enemy and to open out their companies,” i.e. to leave a wider space between each soldier; for, as we were told above, they were conferti.	Manipulus,	derived from manus, originally
“ a handful” or “bundle,” then applied to a small division of soldiers in the Roman army. See note on Army, § 2 (c). In early times their standard consisted of a pole with a handful of straw or hay: so “Pertica suspensos portabat longa maniplos, unde maniplaris nomina miles habet” (Ovid, Fasti, III. 1178). quo facilius possent. [N. S. V. E. p. 137.]
Cujus adventu. [§ 112.]
26.
j uxta. I. e. near the twelfth legion. See the Plan, p. 124. tribunos militum monuit, ut paulatim sese
legiones conjungerent. “He ordered the tribunes of the soldiers (see note on Army, § 5 (d)) to cause the legions gradually to draw together, and after changing their front, to attack the enemy.” Of this manoeuvre, somewhat vaguely described by Caesar, there are three possible explanations:—
The legions were to fight back to back, one having
faced about (signa conversa).
The legions were to wheel round (signa conversa), to bring
themselves into line, and then together attack theenemy.
The legions, after drawing together, were to wheel so as
to fonn an angle with one another, and face the enemy
in two directions.
Of these three explanations the last may be compared with I. 25,' 5, 6, where a parallel manoeuvre is described in very similar language.
neque timerent, ne aversi ab hoste circum- venirentur.- “And were no longer afraid that they should be surrounded by the enemy, while their backs were turned,” i.e. that the enemy should surround and attack them in the rear. The exact meaning of this passage depends of course onthe meaning attached to the manoeuvre described above; the corresponding explanations being
Because the united legions fronted both ways, and so
could not be attacked in the rear.
Because the united line would extend far enough to
prevent the enemy from outflanking them.
Because the flank of eachlegion was protected by theother.
timerent. The subject is milites, to be supplied from
alius alii, above.
legionum duarum. Le. the thirteenth and fourteenth. Cp. 19, 3.
proelio nuntiato cursu incitato. For this double ablative absolute, see note on I. 24, 3.
gererentur. [§ 149.]
subsidio nostris. [§ 108.]
Qui. Masculine plural, agreeing with legionarii, implied in legionem by synesis. [§ 160.] Cp. 23, 3.
quo in loco res esset. [§ 149.] “ What was the position of affairs/*
quanto in periculo et castra et legiones et imperator versaretur. Notice the singular verb used with more than one subject. This occurs when, as here, the nearest subject is in the singular, and special stress is to be laid upon it. “ In what danger the camp, the legions, and, above all, the commander, were being involved.”
nihil ad celeritatem reliqui [§ 131] fecerunt. “ Left nothing undone in reference to speed,” i.e. which could add to their speed. So in Livy, YIL 35, “ nihil vobis fortuna reliqui fecerit”
27.
# 1. procubuissent. [§150.] scutis. [§ 106, a.]
inermes armatis. Notice the close juxtaposition of these opposites for emphasis: “ though the enemy had arms, while they had none. ” In-ermis, derived from in (negative) and arma.
quo se—praeferrent. “In order that they might show themselves better than the soldiers of the legions.”
in extrema spe salutis. “Even whilst in utter despair of safety.” Cp. 25, 2, in extremis suis rebus.jacentibus. [§ 106, a.]
pugnarent —conjicerent —remitterent (section 4).
All depend upon tantam virtutem praestiterunt ut	.
qui superessent. [§ 150.]
pila intercepta remitterent. “ Sent back the javelins which they had caught.”
'5. ut non nequiquam tantae virtutis homines.
‘ ‘ So that it ought to be considered, that it was not without
good reason that men of such valour had dared	”
quae facilia ex difficillimis. “ All which the grandeur of their courage made easy, instead of being very difficult.” Ext literally “ out of what had been.”
28.
gente ac nomine—redacto. An adjective or participle intended to apply to two substantives, as here redacto to gente and nomine, is expressed only once, in which case it agrees with the nearest substantive. Cp. Roby, § 1062.
nomine Nerviorum. Nomen (i.e. gnomen from {g)nosco = “that by which one is known,” “name;” cp. co-gnomen, i-gnomima) is used often of a people all of whom bear the same name.
dixeramus. See note on 1, 1. The fact had been mentioned in 16, 5.
aestuaria. Derived from aestus. “Tidal river mouths.” Cp. III. 9, 4.
nihil impeditum. Derived from in and pes, literally means “ nothing entangled,” “ nothing in the way of the feet.” Cp. expedire, “to disentangle.” Translate “ that there was no difficulty.” senatores. See note on I. 31, 6. qui—possent. [§ 150.]
ut usus misericordia videretur. “That he might be seen to have shown pity.” See on II. 18, 3.
conservavit. “Spared their lives.” So in 12, 5. ut—se suosque prohiberent. “That they should restrain themselves and their friends from doing injustice or harm to them.”
29.
1. supra. I.e. in 16, 4.omnibus copiis. See note on I. 25, 5, hominum milibus.
ex itinere. See on I. 25, 5.
in unum oppidum. The name and position of this town are alike uncertain. Some authorities (amongst them Napoleon) identify it with Namur, others again with Mount Falhize, near Huy, on the Meuse.
despectus haberet. It had uninterrupted views on all sides down (de) into the plain, owing to the steep rocks on which it was placed. Cp. despectus in marc, III. 14, 9.
in latitudinem non amplius ducentorum pedum. See notes on I. 8,1, and I. 38, 5.
munierant—collocabant. Notice the change of tense: they were now adding to the old fortifications which they had built.
duplici altissimo muro. Notice the two adjectives used with one substantive without a conjunction. This often is found when one of the adjectives is a numeral as here, or an adjective of time or place. See on I. 18, 6.
praeacutas. “Sharpened at the end.” Cp. praeustus. In Greek the preposition itp6 in composition is used with the same meaning, e.g. irpo^icrji. See note on praerumpebantur. III. 14, 6.
citra flumen Rhenum. I.e. on the west of the Rhine, “ this side ” from the provincia. Cp. ds Rhenum, 3, 4. For the facts see Geographical Index.
post eorum obitum. I.e. their destruction by C. Marius at Aquae Sextiae iu B.c. 102, and at the Campi Raudii, near Vercellae, in B.o. 101 (see Introduction, § 11). Obire, or in its fuller form, obire mortem, “to meet death,” is generally used of individuals. Here obitum is used of the whole people.
alias—alias. Of time, not of place, in which latter mean- ing it is found only twice in Cicero, and not in other classical writers.
bellum—defenderent. “Ward off war;” the original meaning of defendere, “to strike down or off.” So offendere, “to ptrike against.” See note on I. 44, 13.
30.
1. adventu. [§ 120]. Cp. I. 13, 2, bello Cassiano.
exercitus nostri. Genitive singular, dependent on adventu.parvulis. “Very slight.” Formed from parvus with the common diminutive termination -ulus. Cp. tantulus, puerulus. See note on 1. 8, 2.
vallo passuum in circuitu xv milium. The reading of the test in this passage is uncertain, and the great length of the vallum which our reading implies would lead us to suspect that the conjecture of pedum for passuum is probably correct.
circummuniti. I.e. hemmed in by the Roman siege- walls {vallo—et castellis).
vineis actis aggere exstructo. Cp. note on Army,
§ 9. For the double ablative absolute, see note on 1. 24, 3.
turrim. Turns makes its accusative usually turrim, and ablative often turri; but turrem and turre are both found.
irridere—increpitare. Historical infinitives. [140,2.]
increpitare vocibus, quod tanta — instrueretur. [§ 151.] “To jeer them loudly, because, as they said, such a great piece of mechanism was being constructed at so great a distance.”

corporum suorum. Suorum is used here referring back, not to the grammatical subject of the verb, which is impersonal, but to hominibus, which is in sense the subject of the sentence, as if Caesar had said homines Galli contemnunt. See on 35, 1. See note on Se and Suus, III.

specie. “Appearance,” “sight.”
non existimare. Se, the subject of the infinitive, is omitted here, as in section 3.
Caesar here, as often, takes the opportunity of recording his reputation for clemency. Cp. 14, 5. We cannot help remembering, however, various instances in which such clemency in his dealing with foreign tribes or foreign princes was conspicuously absent, e.g. in III. 16, he relates how he killedthe chief men of the Yeneti and sold the rest. His treatment of Vercingetorix, and his treachery towards the Usipetes and Tencteri (IV. 7-15), may be cited as other instances. On the other hand his clemency to his enemies in the civil war materially helped him in making his way to power. Cicero in his Letters often alludes to it with evident surprise.

Occisis ad hominum milibus quattuor. In numerical expressions in Latin ad is very commonly used to express “about,” “up to.” So I. 4,2, ad hominum milia decern. Occasionally, as here, ad milia was treated as a single declinable expression, the ad being used adverbially, and losing its power over the government of the case; thus, nominative ad milia (cp. I. 29, 3), genitive ad milium,, dative and ablative ad milibus. So “Ad mille septingenti caesi” (Livy, XXII. 41); “Ad duorum milium numero” (Cars. B. C. III. 63, 1).
sectionem. Sectio was a technical term in Roman law for the sale of confiscated goods. When a man's goods were confiscated to the state they were sold as a whole by public auction {venire publice, sub hasta venire), and the purchaser was called sector. This name (derived from secare, “ to cut up”) was given him, because such a purchaser generally divided up the property and sold it again in parts. The process was for the same reason called scctio, a name which was then transferred, as here, to the property sold. Tran slate, * ‘ Caesar sold publicly the whole confiscated property of that town.” This “property” included, as the next sentence shows, the inhabitants themselves.

Cp. 30, 3, and note on Se and Suus, IIL

in Italiam Illyricumque properabat. Illyricum (see Geographical Index) was assigned to Caesar with Cisalpine Gaul as his province, in b.c. 59, for five years, by the Lex Vatinia; the senate afterwards adding Transalpine Gaul also for five years. It was during this visit of Caesar’s to Italy, in the spring of b.o. 56, that the celebrated meeting took place at Luca in Etruria between Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus. The agreement between this triumvirate was there renewed, by virtue of which Caesar’s command in Gaul, which would naturally have terminated in B.o. 54, was prolonged for another five years. By Italiam Caesar seems to mean Cisalpine Gaul, as in I. 10, 3. See Introduction, § 2 (1).
hibernacula. “The winter huts” or “tents” of the army; hibemat “the winter quarters” generally.
supplicatio. A solemn supplication to the gods decreed by the Roman senate, to thank them for good or to pray them to avert evil fortune. On the receipt of the news of a victory such a supplicatio was often decreed: the number of days devoted to it varied. In older times it sometimes lasted only one day,sometimes for as many as five. At this time Caesar obtained a supplicatio lasting for the unprecedented space of fifteen days. Later a supplicatio was decreed in his name, to last for twenty days, in consequence of his first invasion of Britain and his passage of the Rhine (IV. 38), and again for his defeat of Vercingetorix (VII. 90). After this the senate often lengthened the time still further in its flattery of successful generals. The full formula was “ supplicatio nomine imperatoris dis iirvmortali- bus decreta est.,f
nulli. Notice the emphatic position in which nulli is placed at the end of the sentence. Cp. 6, 8.{A.U.C. 698.]
BOOK III.
Campaign of Galba against the Alpine Tribes. B.c. 56.
Galba, sent by Caesar to keep open the Great St. Bernard Pass, takes up his winter quarters at Octodurus, where the Gauls determine to attack him.
Cum in Italiam proficisceretur Caesar, Servium Qalbam cum legione xn et parte equitatus in Nantuatis, Veragros Sedunosque misit, qui ab finibus Allobrogum et lacu Lemanno et flumine Ehodano ad summas Alpes pertinent. Causa mittendi fuit, quod iter per Alpes, 2 quo magno cum periculo magnisque cum portoriis mercatores ire consuerant, patefieri volebat. Huic permisit, 3 si opus esse arbitraretur, uti in his locis legionem hiemandi causa collocaret Galba secundis aliquot proeliis 4 factis castellisque compluribus eorum expugnatis missis ad eum undique legatis obsidibusque datis et pace facta constituit cohortes duas in Nantuatibus collocare et ipse cum reliquis ejus legionis cohortibus in vico Veragrorum, qui appellatur Octodurus, hiemare; qui vicus positus 5 in valle non magna adjecta planicie altissimis montibus undique continetur. Cum hic in duas partes flumine 6 divideretur, alteram partem ejus vici Gallis [ad hiemandum] concessit, alteram vacuam ab his relictam cohortibus attribuit.
Eum locum vallo fossaque munivit. Cum dies hibernorum complures transissent, frumentumque eo comportari j ussisset, subito per exploratores certior factus .est ex ea: parte vici, quam Gallis concesserat,omnes noctu discessisse montesque, qui impenderent, a maxima multitudine Sedunorum et Veragrorum teneri.
Id aliquot de causis acciderat, ut subito Galli belli renovandi legionisque opprimendae consilium caperent:
primum, quod legionem neque eam plenissimam detractis cohortibus duabus et compluribus singillatim, qui commeatus petendi causa missi erant, propter paucitatem
despiciebant; tum etiam, quod propter iniquitatem loci, cum ipsi ex montibus in vallem decurrerent et tela conjicerent, ne primum quidem posse impetum suum sus-
tineri existimabant. Accedebat, quod suos ab se liberos abstractos obsidum nomine dolebant, et Romanos non solum itinerum causa, sed etiam perpetuae possessionis culmina Alpium occupare conari et ea loca finitimae provinciae adjungere sibi persuasum habebant.
Galba calls a council of war, which decides to defend the camp.
His nuntiis acceptis Galba, cum neque opus hibernorum munitionesque plene essent perfectae, neque de frumento reliquoque commeatu satis esset provisum, quod deditione facta obsidibusque acceptis nihil de bello timendum existimaverat, consilio celeriter convocato
sententias exquirere coepit. Quo in consilio, cum tantum repentini periculi praeter opinionem accidisset, ac jam omnia fere superiora loca multitudine armatorum completa conspicerentur, neque subsidio veniri neque commeatus supportari interclusis itineribus possent, prope jam desperata salute nonnullae hujusmodi sententiae dicebantur, ut impedimentis relictis eruptione facta isdem itineribus, quibus eo pervenissent, ad salu-
tem contenderent. Majori tamen parti placuit hoc reservato ad extremum consilio interim rei eventum experiri et castra defendere.
Attack by the Gauls: fierce fighting: final victory of the Romans, though Galba changes his winter quarters to the country of the Allobroges.
Brevi spatio interjecto, vix ut rebus, quas consti-tuissent, collocandis atque administrandis tempus daretur, hostes ex omnibus partibus signo dato decurrere, lapides gaesaque in vallum conjicere. Nostri primo 2 integris viribus fortiter repugnare neque ullum frustra telum ex loco superiore mittere, ut quaeque pars castrorum nudata defensoribus premi videbatur, eo occurrere et auxilium ferre, sed hoc superari, quod diuturnitate 3 pugnae hostes defessi proelio excedebant, alii integris viribus succedebant, quarum rerum a nostris propter 4 paucitatem heri nihil poterat, ac non modo defesso ex pugna excedendi, sed ne saucio quidem ejus loci, ubi constiterat, relinquendi ac sui recipiendi facultas dabatur.
Cum jam amplius horis sex continenter pugnaretur ac non solum vires, sed etiam tela nostros deficerent atque hostes acrius instarent languidioribusque nostris vallum scindere et fossas complere coepissent, resque esset jam ad extremum perducta casum, Publius Sextius 2 Baculus, primi pili centurio, quem Nervico proelio compluribus confectum vulneribus diximus, et item Gaius Volusenus, tribunus militum, vir et consilii magni et virtutis, ad Galbam accurrunt atque unam esse spem salutis docent, si eruptione facta extremum auxilium experirentur. Itaque convocatis centurionibus celeriter 3 milites certiores facit, paulisper intermitterent proelium ac tantummodo tela missa exciperent seque ex labore reficerent, post dato signo ex castris erumperent atque omnem spem salutis in virtute ponerent.
Quod jussi sunt, faciunt ac subito omnibus portis eruptione facta neque cognoscendi, quid fieret, neque sui colligendi hostibus facultatem relinquunt. Ita com- 2 mutata fortuna eos, qui in spem potiundorum castrorum venerant, undique circumventos interficiunt et ex hominum milibus amplius xxx, quem numerum barbarorum ad castra venisse constabat, plus tertia parte interfecta reliquos perterritos in fugam coiyiciunt ac ne in locis quidem superioribus consistere patiuntur. Sic omnibus 3 hostium copiis fusis armisque exutis se in castra munitionesque suas recipiunt. Quo proelio facto, quod 4
BOOK III.]	Lsaepius fortunam temptare Galba nolebat atque alio se in hiberna consilio venisse meminerat, aliis occurrisse rebus viderat, maxime frumenti commeatusque inopia permotus postero die omnibus ejus vici aedificiis incensis in provinciam reverti contendit ac nullo hoste prohibente aut iter demorante incolumem legionem in Nantuatis, inde in Allobroges perduxit ibique hiemavit.
Caesar’s Campaign against tlie Veneti.
B.C. 56.
The Veneti and the neighbouring tribes arrest certain Roman ambassadors.
His rebus gestis cum omnibus de causis Caesar pacatam Galliam existimaret, superatis Belgis, expulsis Germanis, victis in Alpibus Sedunis, atque ita inita hieme in Illyricum profectus esset, quod eas quoque nationes adire et regiones cognoscere volebat, subitum
bellum in Gallia coortum est. Ejus belli haec fuit causa. P. Crassus adulescens cum legione septima
proximus mare Oceanum in Andibus hiemarat. Is, quod in his locis inopia frumenti erat, praefectos tribunosque militum complures in finitimas civitates frumenti
causa dimisit; quo in numero est T. Terrasidius missus in Esubios, M. Trebius Gallus in Curiosolitas, Q. Velanius cum T. Silio in Venetos.
Hujus est civitatis longe amplissima auctoritas omnis orae maritimae regionum earum, quod et naves habent Veneti plurimas, quibus in Britanniam navigare consuerunt, et scientia atque usu nauticarum rerum reliquos antecedunt et in magno impetu maris atque aperto paucis portibus interjectis, quos tenent ipsi, omnes fere, qui eo mari uti consuerunt, habent vecti-
gales. Ab his fit initium retinendi Silii atque Velanii, quod per eos suos se obsides, quos Crasso dedissent,
reciperaturos existimabant. Horum auctoritate finitimi adducti (ut sunt Gallorum subita et repentina consilia), eadem de causa Trebium Terrasidiumque retinent, etceleriter missis legatis per suos principes inter se conjurant, nihil nisi communi consilio acturos eundemque omnis fortunae exitum esse laturos, reliquasque civitates 4 sollicitant, ut in ea libertate quam a majoribus acceperant, permanere quam Romanorum servitutem perferre mallent. Omni ora maritima celeriter ad suam sen- 5 tentiam perducta communem legationem ad P. Crassum mittunt, si velit suos recipere, obsides sibi remittat.
Caesar prepares a fleet to act against the Veneti. They invite allies to join them, and obtain aidfrom Britain,
Quibus de rebus Caesar ab Crasso certior factus, quod ipse aberat longius, navis interim longas aedificari in flumine Ligere, quod influit in Oceanum, remiges ex provincia institui, nautas gubernatoresque comparari jubet. His rebus celeriter administratis ipse, cum pri- 2 mum per anni tempus potuit, ad exercitum contendit. Veneti reliquaeque item civitates cognito Caesaris ad- 3 ventu, simul quod, quantum in se facinus admisissent, intellegebant, legatos, quod nomen ad omnes nationes sanctum inviolatumque semper fuisset, retentos ab se et in vincula conjectos, pro magnitudine periculi bellum parare et maxime ea, quae ad usum navium pertinent, providere instituunt, hoc majore spe, quod multum natura loci confidebant. Pedestria esse itinera concisa 4 aestuariis, navigationem impeditam propter inscientiam locorum paucitatemque portuum sciebant, neque nostros 5 exercitus propter frumenti inopiam diutius apud se morari posse confidebant: ac jam ut omnia contra 6 opinionem acciderent, tamen se plurimum navibus posse, Romanos neque ullam facultatem habere navium neque eorum locorum, ubi bellum gesturi essent, vada, portus, insulas novisse; ac longe aliam esse 7 navigationem in concluso mari atque in vastissimo atque apertissimo Oceano perspiciebant. His initis 8 consiliis oppida muniunt, frumenta ex agris in oppida comportant, naves in Venetiam, ubi Caesarem primum 9 bellum gesturum constabat, quam plurimas possunt,10 cogunt. Socios sibi ad id bellum Osismos, Lexovios, Namnetes, Ambiliatos, Morinos, Diablintes, Menapios ad sciscunt; auxilia ex Britannia, quae contra eas regiones posita est, arcessunt.
Caesar divides his forces under his various “ legati f to prevent other Gauls from joining in the attack.
Erant hae difficultates belli gerendi, quas supra ostendimus, sed multa Caesarem tamen ad id bellum
incitabant: injuriae retentorum equitum Romanorum, rebellio facta post deditionem, defectio datis obsidibus, tot civitatum conjuratio, imprimis, ne hac parte neglecta
reliquae nationes sibi idem licere arbitrarentur. Itaque cum intellegeret omnes fere Gallos novis rebus studere et ad bellum mobiliter celeriterque excitari, omnes autem homines natura libertati studere et condicionem servitutis odisse, priusquam plures civitates conspirarent, partiendum sibi ac latius distribuendum exercitum putavit.
Itaque T. Labienum legatum in Treveros, qui
proximi flumini Rheno sunt, cum equitatu mittit Huic mandat, Remos reliquosque Belgas adeat atque in officio contineat Germanosque, qui auxilio a Belgis arcessiti dicebantur, si per vim navibus flumen transire conentur,
prohibeat. P. Crassum cum cohortibus legionariis xn et magno numero equitatus in Aquitaniam proficisci jubet, ne ex his nationibus auxilia in Galliam mittantur
ac tantae nationes conjungantur. Q. Titurium Sabinum legatum cum legionibus tribus in Venellos, Curiosolites Lexoviosque mittit, qui eam manum distinendam curet.
Decimum Brutum adulescentem classi Gallicisque navibus, quas ex Pictonibus et Santonis reliquisque pacatis regionibus convenire jusserat, praeficit et, cum primum posset, in Venetos proficisci jubet. Ipse eo pedestribus copiis contendit.
The enemy's towns are situated on small promontories and islands, and are therefore difficult to reach owing to the tides.
Erant ejusmodi fere situs oppidorum, ut positain extremis lingulis promunturiisque neque pedibus aditum haberent, cum ex alto se aestus incitavisset, quod bis accidit semper horarum xxmi spatio, neque navibus, quod rursus minuente aestu naves in vadis afflictarentur. Ita utraque re oppidorum oppugnatio impediebatur; 2 ac si quando magnitudine operis forte superati, extruso 3 mari aggere ac molibus atque his oppidi moenibus adaequatis, suis fortunis desperare coeperant, magno numero navium appulso, cujus rei summam facultatem habebant, sua deportabant omnia seque in proxima oppida recipiebant: ibi se rursus isdem opportunitatibus 4 loci defendebant. Haec eo facilius magnam partem 5 aestatis faciebant, quod nostrae naves tempestatibus detinebantur, summaque erat vasto atque aperto mari, magnis aestibus, raris ac prope nullis portibus, difficultas navigandi
Description of the ships and naval tactics of the enemy.
Namque ipsorum naves ad hunc modum factae armataeque erant: carinae aliquanto planiores quam nostrarum navium, quo facilius vada ac decessum aestus excipere possent; prorae admodum erectae atque item 2 puppes ad magnitudinem fluctuum tempestatumque accommodatae, naves totae factae ex robore ad quamvis 3 vim et contumeliam perferendam; transtra pedalibus in 4 altitudinem trabibus confixa clavis ferreis digiti pollicis crassitudine; ancorae pro funibus ferreis catenis re- 5 vinctae: pelles pro velis alutaeque tenuiter confectae, 6 hae sive propter lini inopiam atque ejus usus inscientiam, sive eo, quod est magis verisimile, quod tantas tempestates Oceani tantosque impetus ventorum sustineri ac tanta onera navium regi velis non satis commode posse arbitrabantur. Cum his navibus nostrae classi 7 ejusmodi congressus erat, ut una celeritate et pulsu remorum praestaret, reliqua pro loci natura, pro vi tempestatum illis essent aptiora et accommodatiora. Neque enim his nostrae rostro nocere poterant (tanta in 8 iis erat firmitudo), neque propter altitudinem faciletelum adigebatur, et eadem de causa minus commode
9 copulis continebantur. Accedebat, ut, cum saevire ventus coepisset et se vento dedissent, et tempestatem ferrent facilius et in vadis consisterent tutius, et ab aestu relictae nihil saxa et cautes timerent; quarum rerum omnium nostris navibus casus erat extimescendus.
A naval battle, in which the Roman ships specially adapted for the occasion are completely victorious.
Compluribus expugnatis oppidis Caesar, ubi intellexit frustra tantum laborem sumi, neque hostium fugam captis oppidis reprimi neque iis noceri posse,
statuit exspectandam classem. Quae ubi convenit ac primum ab hostibus visa est, circiter ccxx naves eorum paratissimae atque omni genere armorum ornatissimae
profectae ex portu nostris adversae constiterunt; neque satis Bruto, qui classi praeerat, vel tribunis militum centurionibusque, quibus singulae naves erant attributae, constabat, quid agerent aut quam rationem pugnae
insisterent. Rostro enim noceri non posse cognoverant: turribus autem excitatis tamen has altitudo puppium ex barbaris navibus superabat, ut neque ex inferiore loco satis commode tela adigi possent et missa ab Gallis
gravius acciderent. Una erat magno usui res praeparata a nostris, falces praeacutae insertae affixaeque longuriis
non absimili forma muralium falcium. His cum funes, qui antemnas ad malos destinabant, comprehensi adduc- tique erant, navigio remis incitato praerumpebantur.
Quibus abscisis antemnae concidebant, ut, cum omnis Gallicis navibus spes in velis armamentisque consisteret, his ereptis omnis usus navium uno tempore eriperetur.
Reliquum erat certamen positum in virtute, qua nostri milites facile superabant atque eo magis, quod in conspectu Caesaris atque omnis exercitus res gerebatur, ut
nullum paulo fortius factum latere posset; omnes enim colles ac loca superiora, unde erat propinquus despectus in mare, ab exercitu tenebantur.
Disjectis, ut diximus, antemnis, cum singulasbinae ac temae naves circumsteterant, milites summa vi transcendere in hostium naves contendebant. Quod 2 postquam barbari heri animadverterunt, expugnatis compluribus navibus, cum ei rei nullum reperiretur auxilium, fuga salutem petere contenderunt. Ac jam 3 conversis in eam partem navibus, quo ventus ferebat, tanta subito malacia ac tranquillitas exstitit, ut se ex loco commovere non possent. Quae quidem res ad 4 negotium conficiendum maxime fuit opportuna: nam 5 singulas nostri consectati expugnaverunt, ut perpaucae ex omni numero noctis interventu ad terram pervenerint, cum ab hora fere quarta usque ad solis occasum pugnaretur.
Surrender and punishment of the Veneti.
Quo proelio bellum Venetorum totiusque orae maritimae confectum est. Nam cum omnis juventus, 2 omnes etiam gravioris aetatis, in quibus aliquid consilii aut dignitatis fuit, eo convenerant, tum navium quod ubique fuerat in imum locum coegerant; quibus amissis 3 reliqui neque quo se reciperent, neque quemadmodum oppida defenderent, habebant. Itaque se suaque omnia 4 Caesari dediderunt. In quos eo gravius Caesar vindicandum statuit, quo diligentius in reliquum tempus a barbaris jus legatorum conservaretur. Itaque omni senatu necato reliquos sub corona vendidit.
Campaign of Sabinus against the Venelli.
B.C. 56.
Sabinusy confronted by the hostile forces of Viridovix, declines to march out from his camp.
Dum haec in Venetis geruntur, Q. Titurius Sabinus cum iis copiis, quas a Caesare acceperat, in fines Venellorum pervenit. His praeerat Viridovix ac 2 summam imperii tenebat earum omnium civitatum, - quae defecerant, ex quibus exercitum magnasque copias coegerat; atque his paucis diebus Aulerci Eburovices 3 Lexoviique senatu suo interfecto, quod auctores belliesse nolebant, portas clauserunt seque cum Virido vice
conjunxerunt: magnaque praeterea multitudo undique ex Gallia perditorum hominum latronumque convenerat, quos spes praedandi studiumque bellandi ab agricultura
et cotidiano labore revocabat. Sabinus idoneo omnibus rebus loco castris sese tenebat; cum Viridovix contra eum duum milium spatio consedisset cotidieque productis copiis pugnandi potestatem faceret, ut jam non solum hostibus in contemptionem Sabinus veniret, sed etiam nostrorum militum vocibus nonnihil car-
peretur; tantamque opinionem timoris praebuit, ut jam
ad vallum castrorum hostes accedere auderent. Id ea de causa faciebat, quod cum tanta multitudine hostium, praesertim eo absente, qui summam imperii teneret, nisi aequo loco aut opportunitate aliqua data legato dimicandum non existimabat.
His scheme for persuading the enemy to attack his camp succeeds.
They are routed\ and surrender,
Hac confirmata opinione timoris idoneum quondam hominem et callidum delegit, Gallum, ex iis, quos
auxilii causa secum habebat. Huic magnis praemiis pollicitationibusque persuadet, uti ad hostes transeat,
et, quid fieri velit, edocet. Qui ubi pro perfuga ad eos venit, timorem Romanorum proponit, quibus angustiis
ipse Caesar a Venetis prematur, docet, neque longius abesse, quin proxima nocte Sabinus clam ex castris exercitum educat et ad Caesarem auxilii ferendi causa
proficiscatur. Quod ubi auditum est, conclamant omnes occasionem negotii bene gerendi amittendam non esse:
ad castra ire oportere. Multae res ad hoc consilium Gallos hortabantur; superiorum dierum Sabini cunctatio, perfugae confirmatio, inopia cibariorum, cui rei parum diligenter ab iis erat provisum, spes Venetici belli et quod fere libenter homines id, quod volunt* credunt.
His rebus adducti non prius Viridovicem reliquosque duces ex concilio dimittunt, quam ab his sit concessum,
arma uti capiant et ad castra contendant. Qua re con-cessa laeti, ut explorata victoria, sarmentis virgultisque collectis, quibus fossas Romanorum compleant, ad castra pergunt.
Locus erat castrorum editus et paulatim ab imo acclivis circiter passus mille. Huc magno cursu contenderunt, ut quam minimum spatii ad se colligendos armandosque Romanis daretur, exanimatique pervenerunt. Sabinus suos hortatus cupientibus signum dat. 2 Impeditis hostibus propter ea, quae ferebant, onera subito duabus portis eruptionem fieri jubet Factum 3 est opportunitate loci, hostium inscientia ac defeti- gatione, virtute militum et superiorum pugnarum exercitatione, ut ne unum quidem nostrorum impetum ferrent ac statim terga verterent. Quos impeditos integris 4 viribus milites nostri consecuti magnum numerum eorum occiderunt; reliquos equites consectati paucos, qui ex fuga evaserant, reliquerunt. Sic uno tempore et de 5 navali pugna Sabinus et de Sabini victoria Caesar certior factus est, civitatesque omnes se statim Titurio dediderunt. Nam ut ad bella suscipienda Gallorum alacer 6 ac promptus est animus, sic mollis ac minime resistens ad calamitates perferendas mens eorum est.
Expedition of Crassus into Aquitania.
Crassus marches against the Sontiates, who attack him from
ambuscades: after fierce fighting they are defeated\ Thei?
chief town is stormed, and they surrender.
Eodem fere tempore P. Crassus, cum in Aquitaniam pervenisset, quae pars, ut ante dictum est, et regionum latitudine et miiltitudine hominum ex tertia parte Galliae est aestimanda, cum intellegeret, in iis locis sibi bellum gerendum, ubi paucis ante annis L. Valerius Praeconinus legatus exercitu pulso interfectus esset, atque unde L. Mallius proconsul impedimentis amissis profugisset, non mediocrem sibi diligentiam adhibendam intellegebat. Itaque re frumentaria pro- 2 visa, auxiliis equitatuque comparato, multis praetereaviris fortibus Tolosa et Narbone, quae sunt civitates Galliae provinciae finitimae his regionibus, nominatim evocatis in Sontiatum fines exercitum introduxit.
Cujus adventu cognito Sontiates magnis copiis coactis equitatuque, quo plurimum valebant, in itinere agmen nostrum adorti primum equestre proelium commiserunt,
deinde equitatu suo pulso atque insequentibus nostris Bubito pedestres copias, quas in convalle in insidiis collocaverant, ostenderunt. Hi nostros disjectos adorti proelium renovarunt.
Pugnatum est diu atque acriter, cum Sontiates superioribus victoriis freti in sua virtute totius Aquitaniae salutem positam putarent, nostri autem, quid sine imperatore et sine reliquis legionibus adulescentulo duce efficere possent, perspici cuperent: tandem con-
fecti vulneribus hostes terga vertere. Quorum magno numero interfecto Crassus ex itinere oppidum Sontiatum oppugnare coepit. Quibus fortiter resistentibus vineas
turresque egit. Illi alias eruptione temptata, alias cuniculis ad aggerem vineasque actis (cujus rei sunt longe peritissimi Aquitani, propterea quod multis locis apud eos aerariae structurae sunt), ubi diligentia nostrorum nihil his rebus profici posse intellexerunt, legatos ad Crassum mittunt seque in deditionem ut recipiat, petunt. Qua re impetrata arma tradere jussi faciunt.
Sortie of Adiatunnus and his “soldurii:” these are repulsed,, and surrender.
Atque in ea re omnium nostrorum intentis animis alia ex parte oppidi Adiatunnus, qui summam imperii tenebat, cum DC devotis, quos illi soldurios
appellant, quorum haec est condicio, uti omnibus in vita commodis una cum iis fruantur, quorum se amicitiae dediderint, si quid his per vim accidat, aut eundem casum una ferant aut sibi mortem consciscant;
neque adhuc hominum memoria repertus est quisquam, qui eo interfecto, cujus se amicitiae devovisset, morirecusaret: cum his Adiatunnus eruptionem facere 4 conatus clamore ab ea parte munitionis sublato, cum ad arma milites concurrissent vehementerque ibi pugnatum esset, repulsus in oppidum tamen, uti eadem deditionis condicione uteretur, ab Crasso impetravit.
In the country of the Vocates attd the Tarusates Crassus is met by a fresh confederate force; he attacks it, and captures the camp. The victory is followed bv the surrender of the chief tribes of Aquitania,
23m Armis obsidibusque acceptis Crassus in fines Vocatium et Tarusatium profectus est Tum vero 2 barbari commoti, quod oppidum et natura loci et manu munitum paucis diebus, quibus eo ventum erat, expugnatum cognoverant, legatos quoquoversum dimittere, conjurare, obsides inter se dare, copias parare coeperunt. Mittuntur etiam ad eas civitates legati, quae sunt 3 citerioris Hispaniae finitimae Aquitaniae: inde auxilia ducesque arcessuntur. Quorum adventu magna cum 4 auctoritate et magna cum hominum multitudine bellum gerere conantur. Duces vero ii deliguntur, qui una 5 cum Q. Sertorio omnes annos fuerant summamque scientiam rei militaris habere existimabantur. Hi con- 6 suetudine populi Romani loca capere, castra munire, commeatibus nostros intercludere instituunt. Quod ubi 7 Crassus animadvertit, suas copias propter exiguitatem non facile diduci, hostem et vagari et vias obsidere et castris satis praesidii relinquere, ob eam causam minus commode frumentum commeatumque sibi supportari, in dies hostium numerum augeri, non cunctandum existimavit, quin pugna decertaret.
24- Hac re ad consilium delata ubi omnes idem sentire intellexit, posterum diem pugnae constituit. Prima luce productis omnibus copiis duplici acie instituta, auxiliis in mediam aciem conjectis, quid hostes consilii caperent, exspectabat. Illi, etsi propter mul- 2 titudinem et veterem belli gloriam paucitatemque nostrorum se tuto dimicaturos existimabant, tamentutius esse arbitrabantur obsessis viis commeatu inter-
cluso sine ullo vulnere victoria potiri et, si propter inopiam rei frumentariae Bomani sese recipere coepissent, impeditos in agmine et sub sarcinis infirmiore animo
adoriri cogitabant Hoc consilio probato ab ducibus
productis Romanorum copiis sese castris tenebant. Hac re perspecta Crassus, cum sua cunctatione atque opinione timoris hostes nostros milites alacriores ad pugnandum effecissent, atque omnium voces audirentur, exspectari diutius non oportere, quin ad castra iretur, cohortatus suos omnibus cupientibus ad hostium castra contendit.
Ibi cum alii fossas complerent, alii multis telis conjectis defensores vallo munitionibusque depellerent, auxiliaresque, quibus ad pugnam non multum Crassus confidebat, lapidibus telisque subministrandis et ad aggerem cespitibus comportandis speciem atque opinionem pugnantium praeberent, cum item ab hostibus constanter ac non timide pugnaretur telaque ex loco
2 superiore missa non frustra acciderent, equites circumitis hostium castris Crasso renuntiaverunt non eadem esse diligentia ab decumana porta castra munita facilemque aditum habere.
Crassus equitum praefectos cohortatus, ut magnis praemiis pollicitationibusque suos excitarent, quid fieri
velit, ostendit. Illi, ut erat imperatum, eductis iis cohortibus, quae praesidio castris relictae intritae ab labore erant, et longiore itinere circumductis, ne ex hostium castris conspici possent, omnium oculis mentibusque ad pugnam intentis celeriter ad eas, quas diximus,
munitiones pervenerunt atque his prorutis prius in hostium castris constiterunt, quam plane ab his videri
aut, quid rei gereretur, cognosci posset Tum vero clamore ab ea parte audito nostri redintegratis viribus, quod plerumque in spe victoriae accidere consuevit,
acrius impugnare coeperunt. Hostes undique circumventi desperatis omnibus rebus se per munitiones dejicere
et fuga salutem petere intenderunt. Quos equitatus apertissimis campis consectatus ex milium L numero,quae ex Aquitania Cantabrisque convenisse constabat, vix quarta parte relicta multa nocte se in castra recipit.
Hac audita pugna maxima pars Aquitaniae sese Crasso dedidit obsidesque ultro misit; quo in numero fuerunt Tarbelli, Bigerriones, Ptianii, Vocates, Tarusates, Elusates, Gates, Ausci, Garumni, Sibuzates, Cocosates: paucae ultimae nationes anni tempore confisae, quod 2 hiems suberat, hoc facere neglexerunt.
Expedition of Caesar against the Morini and Menapii, who retire to their marshes: his further operations being interrupted by the weather, he withdraws to his winter quarters.
Eodem fere tempore Caesar, etsi prope exacta jam aestas erat, tamen, quod omni Gallia pacata Morini Menapiique supererant, qui in armis essent neque ad eum umquam legatos de pace misissent, arbitratus id bellum celeriter confici posse eo exercitum adduxit; qui longe alia ratione ac reliqui Galli bellum gerere coeperunt. Nam quod intellegebant maximas nationes, quae 2 proelio contendissent, pulsas superatasque esse, continentesque silvas ac paludes habebant, eo se suaque omnia contulerunt. Ad quarum initium silvarum cum Caesar 3 pervenisset castraque munire instituisset, neque hostis interim visus esset, dispersis in opere nostris subito ex omnibus partibus silvae evolaverunt et in nostros impetum fecerunt. Nostri celeriter arma ceperunt eosque in 4 silvas repulerunt et compluribus interfectis longius impeditioribus locis secuti paucos ex suis deperdiderunt.
Keliquis deinceps diebus Caesar silvas caedere instituit, et ne quis inermibus imprudentibusque militibus ab latere impetus fieri posset, omnem eam materiam, quae erat caesa, conversam ad hostem collocabat ot pro vallo ad utrumque latus exstruebat. Incredibili 2 celeritate magno spatio paucis diebus confecto, cum jam pecus atque extrema impedimenta ab nostris tenerentur, ipsi densiores silvas peterent, ejusmodi sunt tempestates consecutae, uti opus necessario intermitteretur



NOTES TO BOOK III.
1.
Cum in Italiam proficisceretur. I.e. at the end of the campaign of b.c. 57. See note on II. 35, 2.
pertinent. “Extend.” Cp. I. 1, 6.
iter per Alpes. This route was the same as the modem Great St Bernard Pass.
magno cum periculo. “Not without great danger.” Cum is not uncommonly used in expressions which come under the general notion of manner or attendant circumstances. [N. S. V. B. p. 186.] magnis cum portoriis. By portoria are meant the dues on the carriage of goods, either imported or exported. See on 1.18,
Translate, “The route by which the traders were accustomed to travel, with great danger to themselves, and at the cost of heavy custom dues.” patefieri. When compounded with prepositions facio becomes -ficio, and forms its passive in -ficior (conficio, conficurr) when compounded with adverbs (e.g. satis, bene) or verb stems (e.g. pate, stem of patere, cale, stem of calere) it remains unaltered in the active, and forms its passive in fio {patefacio, patefio). This rule, however, has its exceptions : thus confieri and defieri are found as well as confici, defici’.
Huic. [§106(3).]
opus esse. See note on I. 34, 2.
missis ad eum undique legatis — constituit cohortes—collocare. Caesar here uses eum, referring to the nominative of the main verb constituit, though, according to the regular usage, we should have expected se. See note on Se and Suus, II. (d) and IV. In III. 8, 5, we find omni ora maritima —ad suam sententiam perducta—legationem ad P. Crassum mittunt. There is, however, an important difference between the two, which will suggest the reason of Caesar’s using eum in the present passage. In the latter passage suam refersto the logical subject implied in perducta, which is the same as the subject of mittunt. ‘ ‘ When they had brought over to their own opinions.” In the present passage the logical subject implied in missis is not the same as the subject of constituit.
vicus. “A hamlet,” “a collection of houses.” See note on I. 5, 2.
non magna adjecta planicie. “ With a plain of no great si^e lying close to it.” [§ 125.]
continetur. “ Is shut in.”
flumine. The river now called the Drance, which joins the Rhone close to Martigny (Octodurus).
[ad hiemandum]. These words Kraner considers to be out of place, since the Gauls mentioned here were not under nrms, but were the ordinary inhabitants of the country. He suggests that the words may have been inserted here erroneously from the next clause, which should then be written cohortibus ad hiemandum attribuit.
2.
vallo fossaque. See note on Army, § 10.
Gum dies hibernorum complures transissent. “When many days of their wintering had passed.” Hiberna, literally “winter quarters.”
per exploratores. See on I. 3, 6; and note on Army, § 4.
a maxima multitudine. An ablative of the agent: for multitudo = “ a number of men. ” Sometimes the ablative of the instrument without a is used with this and similar words.
belli renovandi. [§ 132.]
ut caperent. A clause explaining and defining id. See note on I. 5, 1.
neque eam plenissimam. “And that, moreover, one which had not its full strength.”
detractis cohortibus duabus. [§ 125.] The two cohorts mentioned in 1, 4.
et compluribus singillatim. Understand again detractis. “ As many of the men were away by themselves,” i.e. not in detachments, but scattered about the country separately.
5. Accedebat, quod. Lit. “it was added that they lamented.” Translate, “ Besides this they lamented.”
ab se. “ From themselves.”obsidum nomine. “Under the name of hostages.’* [§ 113.] For the facts, and the justification which the Gauls had for opposing the Roman army, see note on 10, 3. possessio. “Occupation,” usually of land. Cp. I. 11, 5. finitimae provinciae. [§ 106, 4, a.] sibi persuasum habebant. “Were persuaded.” Sibi dative after the impersonal participle persuasum. For the periphrasis with habeo as an auxiliary verb, see note on II. 4, 4.
3.
opus hibernorum munitionesque. “The con- struction of the winter quarters (generally), and (as a special point) the building of the fortifications.’* See note on que explanatory, I. 27, 4. For opus used of military works, cp. II. 20, 1.
frumento reliquoque commeatu. See note on I. 39, 1.
quod—existimaverat. These words give the reason for the neglect of the precautions mentioned in the preceding sentence.
repentini periculi. [§ 131.] multitudine. [§ 119, 6.] superiora loca. “Higher#ground.”
neque subsidio veniri. Sc. posset, from the possent in the next sentence. For the use of the passive of a neuter verb as an impersonal. See [IT. S. IX. F. b, p. 145]. Subsidio is the “dative of the purpose** [§ 108, III.], as it is commonly used with the active voice {subsidio venire, B. G. V. 27, 5). Translate, “Nor was there a possibility of coming up as a reinforcement,” “ nor could reinforcements come up.** impedimentis relictis eruptione facta. See note on I. 24, 3.
isdem itineribus. [§ 121.] See on I. 31, 1, idem. ad salutem. “To a place of safety.”
Majori parti. [§ 106 (3).]

Historical infinitive. [§ 140, 2.] gaesa. A Celtic word for the long heavy javelins used by the Gauls.
ex loco superiore. “ From the higher ground,” their post of vantage, i.e. the vallum mentioned in 2, 1. nudata defensoribus. [§ 119, b.]
8. Integris viribus. [§ 115.]
succedebant. “ Came up to supply their place.” So sub in composition often. See note on I. 40, 11.
ac non modo defesso—sed ne saucio quidem —facultas dabatur. Non modo here is equivalent to non modo non. “If a predicate or other word is common to both clauses, but stands with the latter, the non after modo (or solum) is frequently omitted” (Roby, § 2240). Here the words common to both clauses are facultas dabatur.
sui recipiendi. There are two points noticeable about this expression—
(1a) The reflexive pronoun is used here with the gerundive in the same way as it is with the infinitive (se recipere), when referring to the subject of the verb infinite. Sui recipiendi facultas, “the power of retracing their own footsteps.*’ So in 19,1. See note on Sc and Suus, I. (b).
Although sui is used to express a plural notion, i.e. refers to more persons than one, the gerundive remains in the singular number. The probable explanation of this is, that, as at a comparatively early period in the history of Latin, the true genitives of me, te, se (cp. Roby, § 386) disappeared altogether from use, their places were filled by the neuter singulars of the possessive pronouns of mens, tuus, suus (mei, tui, sui), sui being used both for the singular and plural genitive. Hence sui being always grammatically a neuter singular, even when speaking of more persons than one, requires the gerundive to be neuter singular as welL Cp. Roby, §§ 386, 1312; Majdv. §§ 85, 297 b, 417. Cp. sui colligendi, 8,1; B. 0. VI. 9, 6, purgandi sui causalegatos mittwit. We may compare the English duplicated genitive, “that hat of his,” “this book of mine,” “ a servant of my mother’s. ”
5-
nostros deficerent. See note on II. 10, 4.
languidioribusque nostris. [§ 125, a.]
primi pili centurio. Cp. II. 25, 1. See note on Army, § 5 (e).
Nervico proelio. The great battle against the Nervii fought in the previous year, B.c. 57, the particulars of which are given in II. 19~28.
tribunus militum. See note on Army, § 5 («d).
consilii magni et virtutis. [§ 128.] Magni, though in sense applying to consilii and virtutis, is according to the rule expressed only once, and made to agree with the nearost noun, consilii. Cp. 8, 2.
si extremum auxilium experirentur. “If they were to make trial of their last resource. ” The imperfect subjunctive is used here because docent, on which it depends, is historical present. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (3).
intermitterent. See pote ton Reported Speech, II. («)•
exciperent tela missa. “Receive the missiles on their shields,” i.e. ward off from themselves. Cp. pila intercepta, II. 27, 4.
6.
Quod jussi sunt. Sc. facere. “ What they are ordered to do.”
omnibus portis. [§ 121.]
fleret. [§ 149.]
sui colligendi. See note on 4, 4.
potiundorum castrorum. For the explanation of the use of the gerundive attraction in this verb instead of the gerund, see note on II. 7, 2.
milibus amplius triginta. [N. S. V. K. 2, p. 138.] See on I. 38, 5.tertia parte. See note on I. 12, 2.
copiis fusis armisque exutis. Exults agrees with copiis, armis being ablative after exutis [§ 119, 1]; for the ordinary construction of exuere is accusative of person, ablative of thing—exuere hostem armis. For a similar combination of ablatives, cp. I. 10, 5.
atque alio se in hiberna—viderat. “ As he remembered that he had retired into winter quarters with one object, whilst he had found himself face to face with quite other conditions.” The verbs meminerat and viderat are both dependent on quod. The omission of a conjunction [asyndeton), especially between two clauses each containing alius, is very common.
frumenti commeatusque. “ Com and other military supplies.” See note on I. 39, 1.
reverti. Revertor, used here as a deponent verb in sense ; lit “ I turn myself back,” i.e. “ I turn back.” Reverto is used intransitively with the same meaning in II. 29, 1.
As to Caesar’s historical accuracy in this section we most notice that he is evidently trying to excuse and minimise what was clearly failure and discomfiture on the part of his legatus Galba. So in I. 15, 2*4, he passes hurriedly over the successes of the Helvetii in a cavalry engagement against the Bomans.
7.
superatis Belgis, etc. The conquest of the Belgae is recounted in II. 1-33, the expulsion from Gaul of the German tribes under Ariovistus in 1. 30-54, and the defeat of the Seduni in 4-6.
inita hieme. See note on II. 2, 1.
eas nationes. The tribes of Illyricum.
proximus mare Oceanum. For the accusative with proximus, and its other constructions, see note on I. 1, 3. Oceanum in apposition to mare.
praefectos tribunosque militum. See note on Army, § 5 (d) and (/).8.
Hujus civitatis. I.c. the state of the Veneti, the last people mentioned.
auctoritas omnis orae maritimae [§ 132] regionum earum [§ 130].	“	Influence	oyer	all	the sea coast in those
parts.”
scientia ac usu. “ Technical knowledge and experience.” See on II. 20, 3.
reliquos antecedunt. [N. S. III. B. (3), p. 184.]
in magno impetu maris atque aperto. Lit. “ in the great and open (i.e. unbroken) violence of the sea.” Translate, “ In a very rough and open sea.” Aperto is explained by what follows: the sea is open, not shut up in bays, so that ships were compelled to put into the few ports, which belonged to the Veneti, in return for which they paid toll to the Veneti (Veneti omnes habent vectigales).
Ab his fit initium retinendi Silii atque Velanii. A compressed form of expression. “They begin the arrest of the ambassadors by seizing Silius and Velanius;” retinendi agreeing with the nearest substantive. Cp. 5, 2.
Ab his. [§ 122, b.]
ut sunt Gallorum subita et repentina consilia. “Just as the plans of the Gauls are always rash and hasty;” “according to the usual rash haste of the Gauls.”
per principes. See note on I. 3, 6.
inter se conjurant—acturos. The subject to acturos is omitted, as obvious, and in order to avoid the awkward repetition of se. See on I. 7, 3, rogarc.
eundem omnis fortunae—laturos.	“And would
together bear the issue of whatever might befall them.”
quam a majoribus acceperant. We might have expected accepissent here, as representing part of what was urged by the Veneti, and therefore as being in oratio obliqua. Caesar, however, by using the indicative, states rather the historical fact, apart from the representations of the Veneti.
mallent. Imperfect after the historical present sollicitant. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (8).
ad suam sententiam. Suam is used here, referring to the nominative of mittunt. See note on Se and Suus, II. (d)but contrast 1, 4, and see note there, missis ad eum undique legatis—constituit. remittat. See note on St and Suus, II. (e).
//	9.
navis longas. “ Ships of war,” as being longer and narrower than the merchant ships {naves onerariae), for purposes of speed and manoeuvring. So in Greek vavs fiaicph, “ a ship of war.”
remiges. From rcmex (derived from remits, ago), an oarsman.
gubernatores. Closely connected with the Greek Kvfiep- it is used here in its original meaning of helmsman, pilot. Its subsequent meaning of “governor” is derived from this, as we speak of “ guiding the helm of the state.” For the remiges no specially skilled workers were required, so that they could be levied from the Province {ex provincia institui). The other sailors, to whom would belong the business of managing the sails, etc., and the helmsmen, required some trouble to get together {comparari).
per anni tempus. As soon as the time of the year allowed. See note on II. 16, 5.
admisissent. [§149.]
quod nomen fuisset. Explaining legatos. The whole sentence stands in a sort of apposition to the accusative legatos, nomen being attracted into the relative clause.
ad omnes nationes. “Amongst all nations;” lit. “ looking to all nations.” fuisset. [§ 151.]
legatos retentos a se. These words explain the previous sentence, quantum facinus admisissent, being dependent upon intellegebant. Translate, “At the same time they understood the greatness of the crime that they had allowed themselves to commit, in that ambassadors (whose name had always been held sacred and inviolate amongst all nations) had been detained by them and thrown into chains.” hoc. “Owing to this,” “on this account.” [N. S. V. E. p. 137.]
Pedestria itinera. “The line of march for land forces.” aestuariis. See on II. 28, 1.ac jam ut. “And moreover granted that—supposing that— ” Ut concessive. [§ 152, I. (5).] facultatem navium. See note on I. 38, 8.
longe aliam—atque. “Very different from.” See
note on II. 19, 2.	'
frumenta. Plural. “Growingcom.” Seenoteonl.16,2. 10. auxilia ex Britannia. Caesar mentioned the inter-
course between Britain and the tribes of Belgio Gaul in II. 4, 7, 14, 4.
10.
injuriae retentorum equitum Romanorum. “The acts of injustice” (plural) “in detaining the Roman knights.” Notice here the use of the passive participle to express the action of the verb, where the English would use the abstract substantive. Cp. post conditam urbem, “after the foundation of the city.” See Roby, § 1406. Equitum, genitive defining injuriae, Cp. II. 33, 7; see Roby, § 1302.
This paragraph gives the explanation of the previous one. Rebellio—defectio—conjuratio, as well as the clause ne—arbitrarentur, are all subjects in apposition to multa in the preceding sentence, the conjunctions being omitted by the figure called asyndeton. For a similar construction, cp. 18, 6.
novis rebus. [§ 106 (3).] For the meaning of these words, see on I. 9, 3.
condicio. Derived from con-dico; the spelling conditio arose from a mistaken derivation of the word from condo.
priusquam conspirarent. [§ 152, III.]
sibi. [§144, a.]
In this chapter we may notice, that although Caesar is at some pains to explain the course he adopts as due to Acts of injustice and rebellion, he cannot help admitting that the Gauls were fighting to maintain their freedom and to avoid slavery. So also I. 18, 4; II. 1, 3; 2, 5.
11.
proximi flumini. For the constmctions of proximus, see note on I. 1, 8.
adeat. Present subjunctive after historical present, representing the imperative of oratio recta. See note on Reported Speech, II. (c), and III, note (3).dicebantur. A parenthetical indicative, representing a statement of Caesar's, and not being part of the oratio obliqua. See note on 1. 2, 4, patebant. auxilio. [§108.] arcessiti. [§ 94.]
cohortes legionariae. 1* Cohorts of legionary soldiers, ” as opposed to cohortes alariae, who were auxiliaries. See note on Army, § 2, (a).
eam manum distinendam. I.e. to keep away so that they should not join the Veneti.
classi. [§ 106, a.]
posset. Imperfect subjunctive, because it precedes the historical present jubet. See note on Reported Speech, III. note (3). See also on I. 7, 1.
pedestribus copiis. See note on I. 25, 5, hominum milibus.
12.

Translate, “ These embankments being built up to a level with the walls of the town. ” suis fortunis desperare. Dative with desperare [§ 107], though the more common construction with this verb is an accusative, appulso. “ Being brought in to shore.” cujus rei. “ Of which,” i.e. of ships, facultas. “ Plenty.” See note on I. 38, 8.

se vento dedissent. “Had run before the wind.” in vadis consisterent. “Rode in the shallows.” ab aestu relictae. “Left behind by the tide.” Ablative of agent [§ 122, 6]; aestus being here personified for grammatical purposes, the more naturally as it represents a moving active thing, which moved away from the ships. Cp. Roby, § 1221. See note on exdpere in section 1, where the sea is spoken of in a similar half-personal mariner, nostris navibus. [107, cf.] 1   ex barbaris navibus. Closely with superabat. “From the side of the foreign ships.” We should rather say “ on the ships. ” See on I. 4, 1, ex vinclis. The meaning of the whole section is, “ Even though the Romans erected turrets on board their ships, yet the enemy’s ships were built so high in the stem that these turrets did not reach up to them.”
praeacutae. 11 Sharpened at the end. ” So in II. 29,8. Cp. note on section 6.

in long poles, of a shape which did not differ from (that of) hooks used to tear down walls. ” See note on Army, § 9.

E. p. 136.] non absimili. Cp. note on I. 42, 6, non irridicule.
antemnae. “The sailyards.” Destinare antemnas ad malos, “To fasten the sailyards to the masts.” The original meaning of destinare (connected with sto) is “to make firm,” “ to bind.”
funes praerumpebantur. “ The ropes were broken off short.” The preposition prae in composition is commonly used with the meaning “in front,” or “at the end.” Cp. section 5. navigio incitato. [§ 125.]
loca. [§25(6).]
despectus in mare. “A looking down on to,” “view over the sea.” Cp. II. 29, 3.
15.

cum—circumsteterant. The indicative, as here, is the usual mood used by Caesar with cwm, meaning “whenever” (cp. Roby, §§ 1716, 1717), though he occasionally uses the subjunctive. See on I. 25, 3.
transcendere in hostium naves. “To board the enemy’s ships.” The trans expresses the crossing over from one ship to the other.

sub corona vendidit. “Sold by auction.” Captives in war according to Roman law became the absolute property of the captors, and might therefore be sold by auction. In olden times slaves exposed for sale wore chaplets on their heads, a symbol which expressed that the sellers in no way guaranteed them. Hence sub corona vendere.
We may notice here that Caesar thinks it desirable to justify his harsh treatment of the Veneti by alleging the necessity of maintaining the sanctity of ambassadors. Cp. for similar severe measures on Caesar’s part, II. 33, 6.

20.
ut ante dictum est. I.e. in the description of the geography of Gaul in I. 1.
ex tertia parte Galliae aestimanda est. “Is to be reckoned at a third part of Gaul.** The preposition ex'here expresses the starting-point or standard of calculation, as insuch expressions as heres ex assc, “an heir to the whole property.” [N. E. IV. B. c. p. 130.] paucis ante annis. [§ 120.] See note on 1. 18, 6. During the war against Sertorius, who had placed himself at the head of Spanish insurgents (cp. 23, 5), L.

G. 1, 137.] aerariae structurae. “ Mining works, ” aerariae being an adjective from aes, “copper.” There is another reading, aerariae structuraeque, in which case aerariae is a substantive “ copperworks,” like ferrariae^ ironworks.
faciunt. Sc. jussa. “ They carry out their orders.”22.
soldurios. Derived from the root of the German word sollen, ‘‘to be obliged or bound” (English, shall, should), and so meaning the same as obligati, devinctu Their relation to their chief is in another place {B. G. VII. 40, 7) compared by Caesar to that of clients to their patron, for which see note on I. 4, 2.

cum his Adiatunnus. After a long parenthesis, ex
tending from section 1, at the words quos illi soldwrios appellant, to section 3, at the words mori recusaret, Caesar resumes his unfinished sentence, repeating his nominative Adiatunnus, and summing up again with the words cum his what he had before expressed as cum sexcentis devotis. This resumption of an unfinished sentence is called epanalepsis (M, dvd,	from
Xappdva), “ taking up again ”). We often do the same in English with t£e addition of the words “ I say.” “With these men, I say, Adiatunnus.” For other instances in Caesar, see I. 35, 4; II. 25, 1.
23.
et natura [§ 113] et manu munitum. “ Strongly fortified both by natural position and by artificial means,” “ by nature and by art.”

26.
ut—excitarent, quid fleri velit, [§ 149] ostendit. Notice here the change of sequence from historic ostendit and excitarent to primary velit. The change is probably due to a wish to make the narrative more vivid, in the same way as the historical present indicative is constantly used. “Showed them what his wishes are.” See note on Reported Speech, III. note (4).
praesidio castris relictae. [§ 108.]
intritae ab labore. This is not an instance of the use of db with the agent, for intritus is an adjective, not a participle; but as in the phrase integrae db labors, etc., db means “ in consequence of.” Cp. Roby, § 1810.
intritus. Here an adjective, derived from the negative particle in and terot though in Cicero, and generally, it is the participle from intero, with the prepositional in.

contendissent. [§ 151.]
continentes silvas. “A continuous or uninterrupted line of wood.” Contineo as a neuter verb, “to hold together,' ■“ to be continuous,” is very rare, except in the present participle. From this meaning come its derivatives, continuus (see I. 48, 3), continuatio (29, 2), continens, “a continent,” i.e. an uninterrupted space of land, continenter (of time), “ constantly” (I.
8), continuo, “straightway.”

2. celeritate [§ 116] magno spatio [§ 126] paucis diebus [§ 120].
pecus atque extrema impedimenta. “ The cattle of the Morini, and the rear of the baggage.” continuatione imbrium. [§ 111.] “By an uninterrupted rainfall.” See note on 28, 2.
sub pellibus. “Under hides,” i.e. in their tents (tentoria); in modern English idiom “ under canvas.” The winter huts were called casae stramenticiae, because they were covered with stramentum, “ straw. ” See note on Army, § 10.
