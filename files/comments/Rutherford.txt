ab nonnullis etiam, sc. sollicitabantur. Down to solli- citarentur above, Caesar gives us the report of Labienus, but the Indicatives noluerant, studebant, ferebant, &c., show that the analysis of the disaffected is his own. The second nonnullis, and potentionbus atque Us, all refer to the same persons.

He now added other two, the 13th and 14th, making eight in all. Besides the legions he had cavalry, light troops, and Aeduan horse. The forces at his command fell little short of 50,000 men.
1. 6. inita aestate. Caesar never uses the common ineunte aestate, but the perf. parte, very often. The words must be taken with deduceret. Caesar sent Pedius to the place where the new levies assembled, with orders to lead them into Central Gaul as soon as summer began and join the army there.

1. 10. ea loca, ‘that district.' The distinction between the neut loca and the masc. loci is very accurately observed by Homan writers. Loca is used of places, spots, districts on the earth’s surface, or of places in a college or corporation: loci are rhetorical topics or commonplaces.

It defended the end of the bridge on the northern bank of the Aisne, while that on the southern bank (in altera •parte) was protected by Q. Sabinus and six cohorts. Of course the position of Sabinus was also fortified. In fact we are told so in ch. 9 infra, praesidium means, (1) the garrison of a town or fort, (2) the place garrisoned, as here a tete-de-pont, (3) a convoy for baggage.

eo die. So hie dies, iUe dies, is dies. In these phrases dies is masc. with rare exceptions. But the Romans preferred the fern, ill ad hanc diem; ad illam, earn, quam diem; ex hac, ex ilia, ex ea die ; qua ex die.

In this sentence note the antithesis between accessit and discessit: 1 On their arrival, along with the hope of defence zeal to fight for the town came upon the Remi, whereas for the same reason the hope of gaining the town left the foe.*
1. 3. potiundi oppidi. Cp. ill. 6, potiundorum castrorum. Verbs which do not govern the accusative have no gerundive, but potior, fruor, fungor, utor, and vescor are exceptions, as they all governed an accusative in early Latin. We may compare with this such expressions as desperata salute, referred to in the note on p. 28,1. 13.
1. 5. omnibus vicis aedificiisque, quos. The relative agrees with the first antecedent. Cp. Cic. Ep. ad Fam. v. 21: Tibi- que persuade praeter culpam ac peccatum qua semper caruisti et carebis. Livy, v. 44: gens cui natura corpora animosque magna magis quam firma dederit.
1. 7. omnibus oopiis, an ablative of the same kind as omnibus viribus, toto animo, contendere. Caesar also uses cum in such phrases, as 1. 38 : Ariovistus cum suis omnibus copiis contendebat.
ab milibus minus duobus. In such phrases minus is an adverb like amplius. For the abl. cp. infra 30: quo tanta machinatio ab tanto spatio instrueretur. For the adverb, cp. v. 32: a milibus passuum circiter duobus.

up an army, because the hill on which the camp was placed rising gently from a plain extended in breadth, facing the enemy over just so much ground as the army in array could cover, and on either hand it had depressions of side, and in front gently sloping gradually resumed the level, on either side of that hill he drew a trench athwart of about 400 paces, and at the end of the trenches he constructed forts and there placed engines, in order that on his drawing up his army the enemy might not, because they were so powerful in numbers, be able to surround his men while fighting.* The key of this description is pro castris, which proves that Caesar was looking westward towards the Aisne, along the axis of the hill in the direction indicated in the map by the arrow. To his right and left he dug two trenches, one to the Aisne, the other to the Miette (palus). The six legions, when drawn up along the axis of the hill, extended to the Aisne, which protected one end of the line and its rear. The ditches and forts secured its other end.
1. 16. non inferiores. The Roman soldiers were, man for man, a match for the enemy, but they were fewer in number. Caesar goes on to say how he put them on an equal footing with the enemy. The camp stood on a hill which rose from the plain by gentle gradients. The troops under his command, if drawn up facing the enemy, were just sufficient to occupy from end to end the portion in front of the camp. Before and behind them were the sloping sides of the hill, and towards their left flank (which rested upon the Aisne) the front of the hill dipped gradually to the plain. To protect the other flank and prevent the enemy from rounding the end of the hill as well as from pouring in sideways in front of the troops, he drew a trench on each side of the hill and at right angles to its axis.
loco pro castris. As stated above, these words indicate the position in which Caesar imagined himself to be standing when writing this description. From missing this point, other editors have been quite unable to reconcile Caesaris description with the position of his entrenchments as recently discovered.

1. 26. Chap. 18.—Collis ab summo, &c., ‘A hill sloping evenly down from the topmost part inclined to the river Sabis, which we have named above. From that river with a similar upward slope a hill rose, stretching in front of this and directly tpposite, for about 200 paces at its lowest part open, in its higher part wooded, so that it could not easily be seen into. Within these woods the enemy kept themselves in hiding. In the open ground along the river a few pickets of cavalry were seen. The depth of the river was about three feet.* I have given a very literal translation of this passage, that the beginner may understand as clearly as possible the difficult Latin idioms which it contains.
ab summo. The neut. adj. is used for a subst as in in occulto below. Cp. vii. 19, collis erat leniter ab infimo adelivis; ib. 73, stipites ab summo praeacuti et praeusti; vi. 26, ab eius summo.

I.7. a fronte. The 8th and 11th legions had been posted there, and advanced fighting to the river. On the left the 9th and 10th had crossed the river and taken the enemy’s camp. Thus both left and front of the Roman camp were exposed. Tho Nervii now attacked the 7th and 12th or the right wing, their troops ultimately separating into two columns, one of which attacked the two legions; the other attempted to seize the high . ground and the Roman camp.

‘ That—their unexpected resolve to renew the war and crush the legion — had happened from several causes,’ or ‘several causes had contributed to this—their sudden resolve,’ &c.

1. 29. sibi persuasum habebant. Just as in 1. 2 we have id eis persuasit, ‘ he proved that to them; ’ so here ‘ they held it proved to themselves.’ This meaning of persuadeo is not uncommon: cp. vi. 14, in primis hoc volunt persuadere, non interire animas. Cic. Invent, i. 17, si iam quiddam auditori persuasum videtur. Persuasus, ‘ proved,’ 4 attested,’ has even a superlative in Brut, in Cic. Ep. ad Div. xi. 9, persuasissimum mihi est Lepidum recte facturum nunquam.

1. 6. oonsilio. Used of any select body each member of which contributes something to the debate, a deliberative body, as opposed to concilium, a mass meeting which accepts or refuses proposals made by some leader. Here consilium means ‘ a council of war.’

1. 11. neque subsidio . . . possent, ‘and neither could relief come nor supplies be brought up as the roads were closed behind them/ After veniri we have to supply posset from possent, which agrees with the subject nearest it, as in Livy, ii. 11, ut non cetera solum sed perns quoque in urbem compelleretur ; and ir. 26 supra, quanto in periculo et castra et legiones et imperator versaretur. For the combination of the impersonal with the personal construction in the same sentence, cp. 14 infra, intellexit neque hostium fugam reprimi neque iis noceri posse.
subsidio veniri (posset), lit. ‘ could it be come for (their) relief/ The passive of venio is very frequently so used impersonally: cp. B. C. i. 07, plerique censebant posse prius ad angustias veniri quam sentiretur. Subsidio is of course dative.
1. 13. desperata salute. Cicero sometimes uses desperare salutem; Caesar always de salute, except in abi. abs. and in ch. 11 infra, suis fortunis desperare; vii. 50, sibi desperans, where he h the dative.
1. 15. ad salutem contenderent, ‘try to gain (a position of) safety/ The addition of isdem itineribus makes the metaphor difficult. We have a similar expression in Bell.

How non modo,‘not only,* came to be used in sentences where we should expect ‘ not only not/ is made clear by the following literal translation: 4 and not only to an exhausted man of goin^ out of the fight, but not even to a wounded man of leaving that spot where he had taken his stand and retiring was the power given.'

Neither of these two men held any fixed military rank, but were employed sometimes in one capacity, sometimes in another. The term is often applied to Gauls. Till seventeen years of age a Roman was puer, from seventeen to forty adulescens, from forty to sixty vir, above sixty senex.

The pres, participle is less often so used than the past. Cp. Cic. de Or. ii. 43, 184, mores iustos . . . perferentes iniuriarum. It corresponds to a Greek adj. in -uc6s.
1. 22. alaeer is one of a pretty large class of adjectives which have a comparative, but no superlative. To it belong most adjectives in -ilis and -bilis.

See p. xiv.
1. 28. longe peritissime, literally, ‘ far the moat skilful; ’ but as it has no direct reference to any others but tl\e Aquitani, it acquires the force of ‘ very skilful indeed.’ So Sail, lug. 5, longe maxima virtus, ‘ supereminent virtue.'

soldurii. Several explanations of this word are given, of which one connects it with the Basque soldi, a horse, and solduni, a cavalier. According to another, it is derived from the same root as the German sollen, and means devinctus, obligatus. Valerius Maximus mentions this custom, ii. 6,11: Celtiberi nefas esse ducebant proelio superesse, cum is occidisset pro cuius salute spiritum devovissent. Tacitus refers to a similar oath among the Germans (Germ. 14) : cp. vn. 40, clientes, quibus more Gallorum nefas est etiam in extrema fortuna deserere patronos.
