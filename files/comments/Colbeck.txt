Chapter I
Silanum, a stepbrother of Marcus Brutus, whose mother, Servilia, married his father as her second husband. His brothers-in-law were Lepidus, the Triumvir, and C. Cassius, the murderer of Caesar. After the murder he joined Lepidus, and commanded for him and Antony in Cisalpine Gaul.
Reginum. He appears afterwards during the civil war to have guarded the sea between Italy and Sicily in Caesar’s interests. Cic. ad Att. x. 12.
Sextium, was afterwards made governor of Numidia or New Africa: sided with the Triumvirs, Antony, Lepidus and Octavianus, and defeated for them the governor of the neighbouring province of Old Africa.
legatos. See Intr. p. xxvi.
3. dilectum, i.e. he determined to levy further troops in Italy, or perhaps in Cisalpine Gaul. Cp. ch. 32. 5.
Pompeio. Pompey had been appointed for five years to proconsular power in Spain, but in order to influence politics (ret publicae causa) had irregularly remained close to Rome (ad urbem), without laying down his command (imperium). Caesar asks that Pompey will let him have all the soldiers he had raised from Caesar’s province. Note that ipse refers to Pompey.
DIVERSITY OF IOWASacramento rogare = * to enlist.1 Abl. of instrument: P. § 240. Livy has also sacramento adigere. The recruits were said in consults verba iurare.
magni interesse. Magni, gen. of price: P. § 257. For the constructions of intertsse see P. § 291.
opinionem. Opinio means ‘belief,* ‘expectation,’ ‘estimate’; is hardly ever to be construed ‘opinion/ which is sententia. We might say here, however, ‘the public opinion of Gaul.' See bk. v. 48. 1.
quid detrimenti. The Latin prefers this construction, where detrimenti is gen. after quid, to saying quod detrimentum. Op. aliquantum pecuniae:, etc., bk. v. 38; nihil negotii; multum aestatis; the gen. is partitive. P. § 260.
ut. What kind of clause does this introduce here ? P. §421.
ante exactam hiemem. See P. § 393.
16. quas cum Q. Titurio amiserat. He had lost fifteen cohorts,
e. a legion an a half, in the attack of the Gauls on the winter camps. See bk. v. chs. 26-37. These troops had been stationed at Tongres, near Liege, under Q. Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta, and had been tempted out of their camp and then massacred by Ambiorix and the Eburones. This camp was at Aduatuca, now Tongres.

1. Interfecto Indutiomaro, ut docuimus. See bk. v. ch. 58. He was a chief of the great tribe of the Treveri and ringleader of the attack on the winter camps, which so nearly proved successful. See Intr. p. xviii. and map for the position of the tribes.
cavent, ‘ give security'; so cautio formed from caveo means ‘ bail'; French, caution, our ‘ caution-money.* Covert also means ‘ to obtain security.’

proximis, probably the three legions with whom he himself wintered at Samarobriva and the one commanded by FabiuB, which was quartered among the Atrebates. Cp. bk. v. 63.
possent. The subj. here after priusquam is necessary, as the clause is virtually oblique, P. § 490, and expresses intention; but priusquam commonly takes the subj. even where the fact only is stated, as in line 4 of the next chapter.
hiberna. See Int. p. xxvii.
Concilio. A Concilium or general assembly of the nation was a recognised institution in Gaul. See bk i. 30. 4, where Caesar’s permission is asked to hold one. Afterwards he summoned them periodically himself and made attendance a test of loyalty, see bk. vi. 3. 4, so that ui instituerat below must be translated ‘ as he had made it a custom to do.’
ut... videretur, * that it might be clear that he esteemed this more important than everything else.' Note that videretur is personal as always: *it seems that he will do so ’ is videtur id facturus. The subj. is final: P. § 423.
Lutetiam Parisiorum, the ancient name of Paris. The name of the tribe was always added after that of the town, and the name of the tribe alone survived. Bavay (Bagacum) and Bordeaux (Bordigala) are rare instances of survival of the old name of the town itself. See Int. p. xviii.
consilio, (plot ’; not to be confounded with concilium, * assembly.’
pro suggesto, literally 'in the front part of the platform ’: for suggestus, see Intr. p. xxvi.: but we must understand here that the assembly he addressed was that of the Gauls, not of his own soldiers.

Cavarinum. See bk. v. ch. 54. Caesar had made him chief of the Senones, but he was driven out by the tribe and became a refugee in Caesar’s camp. He is now therefore sent to command the cavalry levied from his own tribe. Caesar was dependent on native cavalry in all his campaigns. See Int. p. xxiii*

Labienum. Titus Annius Labienus was Caesar’s ablest legatus. He was profusely rewarded for his services, but jealous perhaps of a general whom he considered no more than his equal, he joined Pompey in the Civil War, counselled the battle of Pharsalia, escaped to Africa to share in the defeat of Scipio, and to fall in the final struggle in Spain at Munda.

iacturls, * sacrifices ’; iactura means literally a casting overboard, to lighten a ship during a storm. Tne facts are given by Caesar, bk. i. ch. 31, § 10. Ariovistus and his Germans settled on the best portion of the lands of the Sequani, appropriated one third of their whole territory at once, and demanded one third more for some fresh Germans who came to join them.

15. admissum, * committed.’ It is curious to note how often our English verbs derived from the Latin commonly have a prefix wnich is not usual in classical Latin. Admittere is ‘ to commit'; comprimere, ‘ to repress ’; excipere, ‘ to receive ’; comprehendere, ‘ to apprehend ’; continere, ‘ to restrain ’; recipere, ‘ to admit ’; concitatus, ‘ excited ’; sublatus, * elated. ’

Zeugma Bays two things by means of one. Hendiadys says one thing by means of two. J'aieris libamus et auro is hendiadys for ‘golden cups.’ Instances of zeugma in English occur chiefly in humorous writing. Dickens is very fond of them: ‘He bolted his door and his dinner.' ‘Mr. Weller then took his hat and his leave.' ‘ He took the oaths and his seat.'

excitari, impersonal passive. The doctrine of the Trans* migration of Souls was taught by Pythagoras, who flourished in the sixth century b.g. Pythagorean philosophers were numerous in the Greek colonies of Italy, and no doubt existed at Marseilles, from which colony the Gauls almost certainly derived their knowledge of the Greek alphabet, but it is hardly likely that the central doctrine of the Gaulish religion was derived so late in the history of the nation, or derived at all from a foreign source. The home of Druidism, besides, was Britain, and the intercourse between Marseilles and Britain must have been small indeed. See Intr. p. xxix.

Original from JNIVERSITY OF 10thr adoption of a German word is due to the fact that these retainers were Germans hired for the purpose, and the institution dates only from the time not long before Caesar, when the Germans began to come roving beyond the Rhine. The ambacti would therefore correspond to the * Swiss Guard * of the French kings or the popes. The other derivation is from two Celtic words—ambit * around,* and aig (Latin agere), ‘ to move * =■ attendants.

That they were sprung from the earth-god Pluto, is the legendary form taken by the belief common to almost all nations in their barbarous state, that they are the aboriginal inhabitants, and sprung from the earth on which they dwell: cp. the Greek word aMxOovos, Latin indigena.

In Latin it is not the same as the perfect; it expresses the completion and continuance of the thing done.

If the last chapter was true only of the roving Germans with whom Caesar came into contact, this, on the other hand, is true of the whole race. Tacitus (Germ. ch. xxvi.) mentions the custom of changing lands every year, It was brought over into England with our English forefathers, and only slowly disappeared as the nation passed from the warrior and migratory state to that of settled agriculture and civilization. The land thus apportioned every year was called the mark, and this gradually became the feudal manor.

bos cervi figura. Bos is a vague word, and is applied even to the elephant, so that no objection can be raised on this score to the belief that the reindeer is meant; Others suppose the creature to be the bison. The one horn must be set down as a traveller’s tale. Perhaps he only saw the animal from the side, or perhaps one horn had been shed and not the other. The palmae ramique point markedly to the reindeer (Cervus tarandus), and fossil remains of these have been found in Germany.
