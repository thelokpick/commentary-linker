aliam = atteram, a fairly common usage after Livy. Cic. Brut. 95: genera Asiaticae dictionis duo sunt: unum . • • aliud,
nostril lingua.
Galli. Caesar uses the term Gallia in its restricted sense of ‘ Celtic Gaul,' § 6; 30. 1; 30. 3.
§ 3. cultu atque humanitate, ‘civilization and refinement;' the second more significant word qualifying the less precise one.
provinoia, now Provence, probably made * the Province * about
b.o. 120.
minime, with saepe.
mereatores, from Massilia (Marseilles), a flourishing commercial centre, of Greek origin.
oommeant: words of motion compounded with cum often contain an idea of ‘ hither and thither.'
ad effeminandos animos pertinent, ‘tend to enervate the courage/
§ 4. inoolnnt, ‘ dwell/ 5. 4; 54. x.
qui . . . quibuscum: not connected by a conjunction, because not coordinative; qui trails Rhenum incedunt is an adjective clause = Transrhenanis.finibus, abl. of the place from which.
onm, ‘ (then namely) when they are either keeping them off from their own territories, or are themselves waging war in the territories of their enemies;’ lit. ‘of them/ [cum = * since * governs a subjunctive.]
§ 5. eorum,(of those peoples ’ mentioned above.
Page 2.
ab Sequanis: ,cp. 23. 3, a novissimo agmine; also a tergo,(in the rear,' a latere, * in flank/ like our ‘ off’ a place.
§ 6. oriri: seldom used of place, usually metaphorically.
§ 7. spectat inter 0.: i.e. < has a north-westerly aspect/ Caesar regards the whole country from the standpoint of * the Province/
Chap. 2.—§ r. X. Xessala, X. Piso, consuls A.u. 693, b.c. 61, i.e. when Caesar was quaestor in Spain. [The conj. et is rare in this phrase: cp. 6. 4; 35. 4.]
inductos, ‘persuaded/
de does (ex would not) imply that they went not to return.
ut exirent, ‘to go forth; ’ plural, civitas being a collective noun. The clause is in oblique petition: cf. L. Primer, N. S. x. 1. (2). (qui videant, 15. 1, which Kraner compares, is not parallel, being an adverbial clause expressing purpose.]
cum omnibus oopiis: i.e. with all their belongings.
§ 2. esse, ‘ (he said) that it was easy, since, etc.'
praestarent, in past time, because presented from the point of view not of the speaker (Orgetorix), but of the writer (Caesar).

angustos, ‘too narrow:' cp. longum est} Thuc. i. 50, ikryal &lLvvuv% ‘ too few to aid.'.
qni patebant, ‘now these did but extend;’ a parenthetic remark of Caesar, as is shown by the mood: if it had been a continuation of the thoughts of the Helvetii, it would have been paterent. [“The Helvetii were old enemies; on them, too, the tide of migration from the North had pressed continuously. They had hitherto defended themselves successfully, but they were growing weary of these constant efforts. Their numbers were increasing, and their narrow valleys were too strait for them. They also had heard of fertile, scautily-peopled lands in other parts, of which they oould possess themselves by force or treaty, and they had already shown signs of weariness." (Froutlc, Caesar, p. 201.)]
Chap. 3.—§ 1. pertinerent: subj. because in reported speech.
comparare, coemere, fooere, oonfirmare. The Latin idiom
Eives each word a copula, or none: cp. 1. 2, lingua, institutis, gibus.
§ 2. in tertium annum, ‘for the third year;’ the aoc.denoting that to which the mind is directed.
lege, ‘by special enactment.’ The promptitude and forethought, rare among uncivilized peoples, seem to show tho presence of a master mind.
§ 4. regnum, ‘ chieftaincy,* not implying in Gaul what it would at Home. It was distinguished from principatus, as being a power actually conferred by the tribe, and not the result merely of wealth, birth, etc., as in the case of Dumnorix: op. 16. 5 ; 17.1; 19. 3; 30.1.
obtinuerat Beware (even in § 6; 18. 9) of translating this verb by ‘ obtain * (<consequor): ‘ in which sense no good writer ever used it,* says Madvfg, on Cic. de finibus, ii. 71.senatus populi Somoni, the usual expression being senatus populusque Romanus (S.P.Q.R.).
§ 5. ut . . . eonaretur, persuadet. The historical imperfect subjunctive follows the historic present.
§ 6. perfacile faetu. The supine is superfluous in English, esset, * he was,’ as he said: hence the subjunctive.
totius Galliae: i.e. totius G, populorum,
§ 7. oopiis includes the ideas of * means ’ and * powercp. 2. r.
§ 8. The sentence is compressed, not to say careless; adducti applies only to Casticus and Dumnorix, whereas inter se fidem et iusiurandum dant includes Orgetorix also.
regno ocoupato is equivalent to a conditional clause, = si
regnum occupatum esset,
firmus, of physical strength, as Gic. firma manus. potiri: here alone in Caesar with a genitive, but this is the usual construction in Cicero for acquiring political power.
Page 4.
posse, having no future infinitive, stands in the present after verbs of promising and hoping.
Chaf. 4.—§ 1. moribus suis: cp. mea sententia, *in my opinion;’ ed lege, * on those terms.’
ex vinclis, ‘in chainscp. 43. 3, exequo colloqui.
damnatum, conditional; * it behoved that the punishment of being burnt should befal him if condemued.' poenam is tho subject, Orgetorigem damnatum the object, of sequi; ut igni cremaretur, a clause explaining poenam, [Cp. 53. 7, for another example of this mode of punishment.]
§ 2. familiam = famulos
ad: 5. 2; 29. 2; Xen. An. 1. i 10, efr ^xtXbv;.
clientes obaeratique. The two classes are almost identical. Caesar uses a Roman word not in its usual sense, but es expressing more nearly than any other the state -of things in a foreign poqntry: cp. regnum, 3. 4, note.ne eausam dieeret, ‘to avoid pleading bis cause;’ ne final [not consecutive, which would be ut non; L. Primer, § 152] : op. Cic. pro Seat. 8.18, ab eis se ereptum ne de ambitu causam dieeret praedicabat.
§ 3. cum oonaretur. Note the tense; it was while these measures were being carried out that O. committed suicide.
armis, abl. of instr. with exsequi.
§4* quin: Cic. pro Flacc. 27. 54, quis ignorat quin tria genera sint
Chap. 5.—§ r. ut exeant, ‘namely to go fort!),’ a clause explaining facere; so the inf. is used 7. 1, cum id nuntiatum esset, eos conari: cp. 2. 1; cp. 13. 2, ut flumen transirent.
§ 2. ubi iam: in b.c. 58, three years after the scheme was first set on foot.
reliqua privata aedificia: i.e. reliqua aedificia quae privata erant.
§3. praeterquam, ‘except,’ occurs once again in Caesar, vii. 77. 6.
domum reditio. The verbal substantive acts as if it were itself a verb; so Cic. domum itio, and obtemperatio legibus.
mensum, older form (and the usual one in Cicero, Livy, aud Ovid) for mensium, the original stem being probably mens-. For the case, cp. dierum xxii frumentum, in Caesar; cibaria eius diei, in Livy.
domo: Lat. Primer, § 121, C. a.
§ 4. cum Us ought to be secum, as referring to the subject of the principal verb, persuadent: the usage is not infrequent in Caesar.
Page 5.
Chap. 6.—§ 1. itinera d. q. itineribus. Note the lawyer-liko fulness of the phrase, common in Caesar and in Cicero’s speeches: § 4, diem qua die; 40. r, consilio ... ad id consilium.
possent: why subjunctive?
vix qua. For the somewhat inverted order, cp. 25.4, multi utchaps. 5-7.	NOTES;	49-
Starent; 43. 3, Ariovistus ex equis ut colloquerentur . . , ivit.
§ 2. nuper: two years before, b.o. 60, by the Praetor 0. Pomptinus.
▼ado transitor, ‘can be forded,’ but this is expressed more directly by saying that ‘ it is forded.’ 80 Cicero, non diiudicatur amor verus et fictus. yado, instrumental abl., qualifying transitur as an adverb, and is therefore in this usage always singular.
§ 3. viderentur. Supply esse; subjunctive because in oratio obliqua.

eos: cp. 5. 4, cum Us, note, sooo refers to the subject of tho subordinate clause, ut . . . paterentur.
eoaetoros. Supply eos from Allobrogibus.
§ 4. conveniant would be imperative in direct speech.
qua die ... is dies. Dies is as a rule feminine Of a date, masculine of a natural day. See Mr. Rutherford’s ‘ Caesar,' u. 6, note.
a. d. V. Kal. Apr., ante diem quintum Kalendas Apriles =s March 28, b.o. 58. Caesar clearly regards the day as a kind of landmark by this precise marking, so rare in his writings. For the asyndeton, cp. note on 2. 1.
Chap. 7.—§ r. eos . . . conari, a clause explaining id; cp. 5. t, note.
ab urbe, ‘from Rome;’ see introduction.
Gallia ulterior: i.e. on the further (as O. Cisalpina was on the Roman) side of the Alps. [According to Plutarch, he reached the Rhone in eight days.]
ad, * in the neighbourhood of,’ not * to,' which would be simple acc. Lat Primer, § 101.
§ 2. Provineiae tOti (dative), only referring to OaUia ulterior.
legio una, the tenth. The asyndeton is meant to indicate the haste with which Caesar issued the orders: 20.6; 22. 3.

Even Boman soldiers could not have dug a continuous trench of the dimensions mentioned and nineteen miles long in so short a time. At parts the natural banks of the Bhone formed a sufficient defence; at all events, no traces of any such continuous work have been found.]

eireum Aquileiam. Winter-quarters were around and not in a town; cp. Xen. An. i. 2.5, KCpos &pparo dirb (not in) Zdpbcuv.
§ 4. The exact route taken by Caesar is doubtful. According to Napoleon, it was Turin, valley of the Chiasone, Usseau, Col de Mont Genfevre, Brianqon, Grenoble, across the Isfere to Lyon. In later times there was a more direct route over Mont Cents.
§ 5. compluribus h. p. p., ‘ these having been defeated in several engagements.* his pulsis, abl. abs.; compluribus proeliis, Lat. Primer, § 118. A similar coming together of distinct ablatives occurs iii. 6. 3, copiis fusis armisque exutis, ‘ the forceB being routed and stripped of their arms.*
ab Ocelo. The preposition is expressed because the departure is 'from the neighbourhood of Ocelum; * so vii. 59, Caesar a Gergovia discessisse audiebatur.
ulterior provineia, usually called simply ‘the Province,* distinguished from citerior provineia, i.e. Cisalpine Gaul.
Chap. 11.—§ 1. per angustias: 6. 1; 9. x.
§ 3. The Aedui also seem to have traced their descent from Trojan blood: B.C. 121, they were styled ‘allies of the Boman people ;* cp. 81. 7, and especially 88.2, fratres consanguineosque; Tac. Ann. 11* 25, soli Gallorum fraternitatis nomen cum populo Bomano usurpant.
nostri: momentary lapse into oratio recta.
liberi eorum. Caesar here leaves the standpoint of the subject (viz. the envoys of the Aedni), and speaks from his own; hence not sui.
§ 4. depopulatis, ‘ having been laid waste,* must be regarded as from the deponent depopulor, not depopulo, which does not occur in classical prose. Many deponents nave a perfeot participle with a passive meaning; so comitor, ‘ I accompany,* but comitatus, * being accompanied.’ See the list in Roby, Lai Gr. book n., ch. xxix.•chaps. 11-13,	NOTES.

Chap. 12.—§ 1. Flumen est Arar. Caesar often introduces thus a transition of subject; e.g. 43. 1, planicies erat magna, quod: op. note on flumine Bheno, qui, 2. 3. transibant, 4were crossing;' note the tense. Napoleon 1. thought this was at Chalons; Napoleon 111., with Yon Kampen and Goler, at Trdvoux; Desjardins, at M&con.
§ 2, do tertia vigilia, in the course of the third watch; i.e. from midnight to 3 a.m.

incommodi, ‘disaster.’ It will be seen that this is an euphemism, since it refers to the same event as insignem calamitatem, 12. 6.
§ 5. quod adortos esset, ‘ with regard to his haying attacked.’
suae refers to Oaesar, the subject of the verb tribueret; ipsos to the Helvetii.
tribueret is used absolutely: so ita didicisse, § 6; ita respondit, 14. i, etc.
§ 6. se ita, ‘ this they had learnt from their fathers and ancestors, rather to contend with valour than to rely upon, fraud or ambuscades.

The sense is,(the fact of their so insolently exulting in their viotory, and of their wonder at having so long (fifty years) gone unpunished for their wrong doings, pointed in the same direction; ’ this direction being the coming vengeance.

§ 8. eupere alicui = ‘ wish one well,’ alicui being remoter object and the nearer object not expressed, suo nomine, ‘on his own account,’ a commercial metaphor, gratiae, ‘ influence.’ The genitive is definitive; that is to say, expresses the position or condition, which was ‘ influence and honour.’ 80 urbs Romae, fons Bandusiae.
§ 9. si quid aocidat Bomania, ‘ if anything should happen to the B.' This softening down is called euphemism: familiar instances are the change of Cape of Bad Hope to Cape of Good Hope, of the Pontos Axeinos (‘ inhospitable ’) to the Pontos Euxeinos (‘ hospitable').
imperio, ‘under the rule.’ Beware of translating imperium as ‘ empire,’ a meaning which it did not acquire until very late times. The ablative is a variety of the abl. of the ‘ time when’ (Lai Pr. § 120); or an abl. of attendant circumstance.
§ 10. in quaerendo, ‘in the course of inquiry ’ — cum quaereret. quod, relative, agreeing with proelium: the antecedent is omitted and proelium drawn into the relative clause. The full construction is in eo proelio equestri adverso, quod factum esset.

The two ablatives absolute are not coordinated by any conjunction, because one is really subordinate to the other: upon the repulse of the horse the phalanx was formed. [The phalanx of the Helvetii resembled more or less the ovvcunrurfUs of the Greeks; the shields locked together formed a complete covering to the advancing line.]
Chap. 25.—§ 1. Cp. Plutarch, Caesar, 18: “ 'When a horse was brought to him, he said, ‘ After victory I will use this for the pursuit, but now let us advanoe agaiust the enemy; ’ and he attacked the enemy, charging on foot.'* Catilina, the Roman traitor, adopted the same desperate manoeuvre.

Many intransitive verbs become transitive when compounded with a preposition : so, eo, ‘I go ; ’ adeo, ‘I approach.’ Many of them, when thus used, can be personally constructed in the passive, convenio among the number: Cic. ad Fam. vi 19. 2, tantis pedum doloribus afficitur ut se conveniri nolit.

§ 6. non irridicule: so 39.1, non mediocriter, 'excessively.9
'Having promised to look upon the tenth legion in the light of a praetorian cohort, he was enrolling them m the horse.9 The pun lies in the fact that whilst at Rome, where the phrase ad equum rescribere was first used, the cavalry were Roman citizens and of higher rank than the legionarii, in Caesar’s army they were Gauls and not Roman citizens at all.

§ 11. illum = te: i.e. Caesarem, as'in § 13; but § 12, eum.
§ 12. Ariovistus implies that Caesar's political enemies at Borne had hinted at the desirability of Caesar's death: and probably it was no empty boast.
§ 13. The tenses are worthy of especial remark in this section.
eius, Caesaris. [Ariovistus's kind offer to Caesar reminds one very forcibly of Lessing’s. fable of the wolf, who offered to the shepherds to turn sheep-dog.]

§ 2. These words of Caesar were no empty boast: little as had been his military experience, he had saved Gaul, nay Borne itself, from the utmost danger; and although it was still only September, he was able to send his army into winter-quarters.
§ 3. ad conventus acendos, ‘for the purpose of holding the assizes,’ one of the duties of the Proconsul. Caesar had a still more important reason for going towards Borne; namely, the furthering of his own political ends. See Introduction.
