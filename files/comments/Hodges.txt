Gallia omnis: Gaul in the wider sense. Transalpine Gaul is meant, exclusive of the Roman province (provincia). See Introd., p. 23, and the map of Gaul. In a narrower sense Gallia meant the land of the Celtae, or Galli, of 1. 3. — est divisa: illustrates the adjective use of a participle. We translate is divided\ A. 495 ; B. 337; G. 250. r. 2; H. 640. 3; HB. 248. — tris: for declension see the grammar. The student should be sure that he knows the inflection of every inflected word which he meets, and should early accustom himself to the use of the index in his Latin grammar. — unam : sc. partem.
incolunt: the passive would be more in conformity with English idiom (one of which is inhabited by the Belgae). — aliam: the regular succession is alter {second), tertius {third). What are the usual meanings of alius and alter?—qui: rel. pron., implying its own antecedent; the third {part those inhabit) who are called. — ipsorum: the reflexive sua might have been expected, but Caesar is speaking from the Roman point of view; ipsorum is contrasted with nostra, as if Caesar had said, ‘ They themselves use the name Celtae, we call them Galli.’ — lingua: A. 400: B. 220. 3 : G. 401: H. 476; HB. 436. b.
lingua, institutis, legibus: in language, customs, {and) laws. A. 418; B. 226; G. 397; H. 480; HB. 441.
inter se: fro?n one another. A. 301. f; B. 245; G. 221; H. 502. 1; HB. 266.
dividit: the verb is singular because the two rivers form a single boundary-line from the upper course of the Marne to the mouth of the Seine. See the map of Gaul. A. 317. b; B. 255. 3; G, 285. exc. 2; H. 392. 4;’HB. 331. 3. Notice the order of

See A. 596, 597, and the translation of this chapter there given; B. 348, 349; G. 672. 2. a, 674. rule I; H. 664, 665. 1 ; HB. 623, 625. —Horum omnium: partitive gen., or gen. of the whole. A. 346. 2; B. 201. 1; G. 372; H. 442; HB. 346 These words, referring back to the previous sentence, are placed in a prominent position.
a cultu : A. 402 ; B. 214; G. 390. 1. 2. n. 1; H. 461, 462. 1; HB. 408. — cultu . . . provinciae: civilization and refinement of the province, i.e. the province, in which are civilization and refinement. See Introd., p. 23. The name provincia gives the modern Provence.
minime saepe : least often, i.e. very seldom. The force of minime saepe extends to important. We should be likely to say, 1 Traders very seldom come, bringing in those things.’
mercatores: these were traveling traders, or peddlers, chiefly from the province. Starting from seaports, as Massilia, they would naturally trade mostly in southern and central Gaul, though they went as far as Germany and Britain. — ad effeminandos animos : to character being weakened, to weaken character; effeminandos is a gerundive agreeing with animos, which is used with ad. Distinguish carefully between the gerundive, a participle, and the gerund, a noun. A. 503, 506; B. 338. 3, 339. 1.2; G. 427, 432 ; H. 623, 628 ; HB. 609, 612. III.
proximi: how is this compared? — Germanis: dat. with proximi. The accusative might have been used. A. 384, 432. a; B. 192. 1, 141. 3; G. 359. N. 1 ; H. 434. 2, 435. 2; HB. 362. Ill, 380. b.
trans Rhenum: the Rhine was considered the boundary between Gaul and Germany, yet migrations across the river were frequent. — quibuscum : for cum as enclitic see A. 150. d; B. 142. 4;
413. r. 1; H. 182. 2; HB. 418. a.

or themselves making war). Notice that suis and ipsi refer to the subject, Helvetii, while eos and eorum refer to the Germans. —suis finibus : abl. of separation.
Eorum: the inhabitants of Gallia omnis, the people being mentioned instead of the land ; so Belgae is used for Belgium in 1. 18 below. — quam : rel. pron., obj. of obtinere, of which Gallos is the subject. The three words form a clause in indirect discourse, and this clause is subject of dictum est. The direct form of the quotation would be quam Galli obtinent. A. 579, 580: B. 331.1 ; G. 508. 2, 343. 2; H. 641,642; HB. 533, 534. 1. — obtinere: does not mean obtain, but hold (against opposition, active or potential). Latin words are often not to be translated by their English derivatives.
initium capit a: begins at.
flumine, Oceano, finibus: notice the asyndeton (absence of connectives), and cf. lingua, institutis, legibus, 1. 3.
ab Sequanis: i.e. on the side where the Sequani live. A. 429. b; G. 390. 2. N. 6; H. 485. 4; HB. 406. 2. What prepositions are used with the ablative? — septemtriones : north. Notice the singular in 1. 19. The word (lit. seven plow-oxen) designates the seven prominent stars of the constellation Ursa Major, the ‘ Great Bear,’ ‘Dipper,’ or ‘Charles’s Wain.’
ab finibus oriuntur: cf. a flumine Rhodano, 1. 15 ; oriuntur is equivalent to initium capiunt. What are its principal parts? What name is given to verbs which have mostly passive forms, but active meaning ? — extremis: farthest from the province. — Galliae: the region inhabited by the Celtae. What rivers formed its northern boundary ?
inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni: we usually say ‘the lower Rhine.’ — spectant in septemtrionem et orientem solem:
lie towards the north and east, i.e. northeast (from the province).
21. ad Hispaniam: near Spain. What is this ‘ part of the ocean ’ now called ?
This chapter serves to introduce us to the people with whom Caesar fought, and to their country. In Bk. VI Caesar gives a somewhat detailed account of the Gallic race. The student should now read Introd., pp. 21-29.
II. 23. nobilissimus: of highest rank. — ditissimus: sup. of dives.
24. Orgetorix: besides proper names, only a few words of the languages of ancient Gaul survive. The names are usually significant. The termination ~rix is frequently found, and means ‘ king ’ (Latin rex). Orgetorix means ‘ king-of-the-killers.’ — M.: read s

this Marco. — M. Messala . . . consulibus : in the consulship of Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso, i.e. 61 B.c., three years before the outbreak of the Gallic War. A. 419. a, 424. g; B. 227. 1; G. 409;
489; HB. 421, 661. 1. The year was regularly expressed in this way. — regni: obj. gen., depending on cupiditate. A. 348; B. 200;
363. 2 ; H. 440. 2 ; HB. 354.
nobilitatis : of the nobles (lit. nobility) ; abstract noun used in a collective sense, as often in English. In most of the states of Gaul the kings had been overthrown and the prerogatives of the old nobility curtailed. But to one who was able to put himself at the head of a mercenary force the field was open for an attempt to overthrow the elective magistrates and become king in fact, if not in name. Cf. Bk. II, Chap. I.— civitati: A. 367; B. 187. II. a;
346; H. 426. 2; HB. 362. I.
ut . . . exirent: A. 563; B. 295. 1; G. 546. 1; H. 565; HB. 502. 3. a. Notice how the English idiom differs from the Latin. In English we say, 6 He persuades me to do this ’; the Latin says, ‘ He persuades (makes acceptable) to me that I do this.’ Persuadeo is from the root of suavis, sweet. Why is exirent plural ? — cum omnibus copiis: i.e. ‘bag and baggage.7 This was to be a migration of the whole people, but yet, as Caesar represents it, it was for purposes of conquest. The Helvetii were to become masters of Gaul.
perfacile: what is the force of perl—esse: inf. in ind. disc., depending on the idea of saying in persuasit. A. 580. a; B. 314. 2 ; G. 652. R. 2 ; H. 642. 1 ; HB. 589. a. The subject of esse is the infinitive potiri. A. 452; B. 327. 1 ; G. 421 ; H. 609. 1 ; HB. 585. Since an infinitive used substantively is neuter, the predicate adjective perfacile is also neuter. Trans, that it was very easy to get the sovereignty of the whole of Gaul. — omnibus: A. 370; B. 187. Ill; G. 347; H. 429; HB. 376. — praestarent: A. 549; B. 286. 2; G. 586; H. 598; HB. 526. The tense is imperfect be-- cause the clause takes its time from persuasit, a secondary, or historical, tense. A. 482, 483 ; B. 258, 267. 1.2; G. 225, 509; H. 198, 543 ; HB. 476. — totius Galliae: obj. gen.
imperio : A. 410; B. 218. 1 ; G. 407 ; H. 477. I; HB. 429. — Id: dir. obj. of persuasit (he persuaded them of this, lit. made this acceptable to them). — hoc facilius : the more easily, lit. more easily by this; hoc is abl. of degree, or measure, of difference, but hardly differs here from abl. of cause. A. 414. n. ; B. 223 ; G. 403 ; H. 479.1 ; HB. 424. a.
loci natura: i.e. by natural boundaries, or obstacles; ex-

plained by the ablatives flumine Rheno, monte lura,, etc. How does the plural of locus differ in gender from the singular? — continentur: are shut in, lit. are held together.—una ex parte: on one side. Notice the Latin idiom, and see note on ab Sequanis, p. 55,1. 17. For the order of the words (adj., prep., noun) see A. 599. d; B. 350. 7. b; G. 678. R. 2; H. 671. 5 ; HB. 627. 4.
latissimo : very wide, not widest. — qui: does this pronoun take its gender from flumine or from Rheno ?
altera: see note on aliam, p. 55,1. 2.
provinciam nostram: the part which the Allobroges inhabited. See the map of Gaul. — His rebus fiebat ut . . . possent:
so (lit. because of these things) it was coming about that they both roamed less widely (than they wished) and could less easily wage war ufon their neighbors. Observe that fiebat is imperfect, and see the grammar for the difference in meaning between the perfect and the imperfect tense. The subject of fiebat is ut . . . vagarentur . . . possent. In Latin, as in other languages, a clause may be used as a noun. Such a clause is called a substantive clause. The subject of a verb is often obscured in English by the little word 1 it.1 In this sentence, to find the real subject of fiebat (it was coming about), ask yourself what was coming about. For the mood of vagarentur and possent see A. 569. 2; B. 297. 2; G. 553. 3;
571. 1; HB. 521. 3. a.
finitimis: for the case see note on omnibus, 1. 3.
qua ex parte: and in this respect. Cf. una ex parte, 1. 5. The Helvetii were distressed on their military side. —homines : not subject, but in predicate apposition with the subject (being men fond of warring).—bellandi: gerund; obj. gen., depending on cupidi. A. 504, 349. a; B. 338. 1. b, 204. 1 ; G. 428, 374; H. 626, 451. I ; HB. 612. I, 354.
Fro multitudine hominum angustos: (too) narrow for the number of their people (lit. narrow in proportion to). Their number is given as 263,000.
gloria . . . fortitudinis: renown for bravery in war, lit. renown of war and bravery. — se habere: ind. disc.; the direct form would be nos habemus.
in longitudinem: in length. Notice that in this idiom the accusative is used with in. What prepositions are used with both accusative and ablative? — milia passuum : miles, lit. thousatids of paces. The passus, a double step, was five Roman feet. The mile, 5000 Roman feet, was equal to about 4854 feet, modern measure. For case of milia see A. 425; B. 181. 1; G. 335; H. 417; HB.

387. I. Observe that it is a noun, and learn from the grammar the use of the singular, mille.
coxl : read this ducenta (not ducenti, for it agrees with milia) quadraginta. The student should always carefully consult his grammar, whenever he is in doubt as to the Latin form of a numeral for which characters are used in the text. — clxxx : to bring this more nearly into accord with the fact, it has been conjectured that Caesar wrote in latihicUnetn LXXX (instead of clxxx) . How do the dimensions given compare with those of modern Switzerland? The pressure of the Germans no doubt influenced the Helvetii in forming their decision to migrate. Read Introd.,
pp. 6-8.
16. His rebus: the special meaning of res must be obtained from its context. Here it is reason, or cause.
ea: obj. of comparare. — quae . . . pertinerent: which were necessary (lit. tended) to their departure. The subjunctive is used because the sentence represents the thought of the Helvetii. A. 592. 3; B. 323; G. 628; H. 649. 1 ; HB. 535. 1. a.—proficiscendum: A. 506; B. 338. 3; G. 432; H. 628; HB. 612. III.— comparare: depends on constituerunt.

in tertium annum : for the third year.
confirmant: historical present, nearly equivalent to a historical perfect; not like the presents of Chap. I. Presents of this kind are much more common in Latin than in English, and should therefore usually be translated by the past tense. A. 469 ; B. 259. 3 ;
229; H. 532. 3; HB. 491. 1.
amicus: this appellation, given by the Roman senate, was eagerly sought by foreign princes, and was (says Caesar in Chap. XLIII) generally given for great services.
ut . . . occuparet: depends on persuadet. See note on ut :. . exirent, 1. 2. For tense see A. 485. e; B. 268. 3; G. 511. R. i ; H. 546; HB. 491. 2.

bitterly hostile to Caesar and the Romans. His elder brother, the	56
druid Diviciacus, was, on the other hand, an admirer of the Romans,
a friend of Cicero, and an efficient helper of Caesar. See Introd., p. 7. For the fate of Dumnorix see Bk. V, Chaps. VI and VII.— qui : its antecedent is Dumnorigi.
eo tempore : A. 423. 1 ; B. 230 ; G. 393 ; H. 486; HB. 439.
— principatum: leadership, not as a magistrate, but as a man of great personal influence. — maxime: especially. For the positive of this word multum or magnopere is used.
Perfacile factu: (a) very easy (thing) to do. A. 510; B. 57 340.2; G. 436; H. 635.1; HB.619. 1. — esse: inf. in ind. disc.; its subject is conata perficere. — conata: a participle used as a noun,
neut. pi. In the singular the masculine noun conatus, -us, is used.
obtenturus esset: subjunctive of the first, or active, periphrastic conjugation, representing a future of the direct discourse.

quin plurimum Helvetii possent: that the Helvetii were the most powerful. For plurimum see A. 390. c; B. 176. 2. b ; G. 334;
409. 1 ; HB. 387. III. For the form of the clause see A. 558. a;
298; G. 555. 2 ; H. 594. II, 595.1 ; HB. 521. 3. b. This whole passage in direct discourse would run as follows: Perfacile factu est conata perficere^ propter ea quod (ego) meae civitatis imperium obtinebo; non est dubium quin totius Galliae plurimum Helvetii possint; (ego) meis copiis meoque exercitu vobis regna conciliabo.
copiis : here resources, not troops.
confirmat: notice the three different meanings of confirmo in this chapter.
regno occupato . . . sperant: they hope that having seized (or when they have seized) royal power they can, through the three very powerful and strong nations, get possession of the whole of Gaul.
The three nations are, of course, the Helvetii, Sequani, and Haedui.
For regno occupato see A. 420; B. 227. 2 ; G. 410, 664; H. 489. 1;

ex vinculis: we should say in chains, but the pleading comes, so to speak, from within the chains. — coegerunt: the Helvetii were very willing to become masters of Gaul, but were not ready to give supreme power into the hands of Orgetorix. — damnatum .. . oportebat : it must needs be that the punishment follow (i.e. be inflicted on) him (if) condemned. What is the subject of oportebat?
ut igni cremaretur: a substantive clause in apposition with poenam.— Die . . . dictionis : on the day set for the pleading of his cause; die is abl. of time. For its gender see A. 97. a; B. 53 ; G. 64;
135 ; HB. 101. The genitive dictionis depends on die, and causae is obj. gen., depending on dictionis. See note on regni, p. 55,
24.
familiam : the usual meaning is household, particularly slaves. Perhaps here it means clansmen, though it is not certain that the clan system prevailed in Gaul at this time. — ad . . . decern: to (the number of) 10,000 men.
obaeratos: many of the common people, either through poverty or through debt, gave themselves up to the service of a powerful lord, becoming nearly the same as slaves.
eodem: the adverb. — per eos . . . eripuit: by means of these he escaped being tried. What literally ? What prepositions take the accusative only? The high-handed action of Orgetorix apparently led to rioting and almost to civil war.—ne diceret: A. 558. b; B. 295. 3; G. 548; H. 566; HB. 502. 3. b.
ius . . . conaretur: was trying to enforce its right, i.e. the right to bring criminals to account. For the mood of conaretur see A. 546; B. 288. 1; G. 585 ; H. 600. II. 1; HB. 524.
multitudinem: hasty levies. The power of the magistrates was military as well as civil.
19. ut arbitrantur: the beginner should notice that ut here is followed by the indicative, and cannot, therefore, mean that, in order that, or so that. With the indicative ut usually means either as or when. — quin . . . consciverit: that he himself decreed death to himself, i.e. committed suicide. A. 558; B. 298 ; G. 555. 2 ; H. 595- 1; HB. 521. 3. b. — ipse : A. 298. f; B. 249. 2 ; G. 311. 2 ; H. 509. 1 ; HB. 268.

The number of the Helvetii and their allies is given as 368,000. Estimating the supply of flour at only one pound per day for each person, we should have a sum total of more than 16,000 tons. An immense number of animals and wagons would be required to transport this great quantity of food, with the other baggage, and progress on the march would be necessarily slow.

usi: having adopted, from utor. But the idiomatic rendering is persuade to adopt, burn, and set out.
cum iis : secum might have been used as an indirect reflexive, but there would have been ambiguity, since suis refers to the subject of proficiscantur. A. 300. b; B. 244. II; G* 521. N. 3 ; H. 504. 3; HB. 262. 2.
Boios : the name of this tribe survives in the name Bohemia. They had probably been driven south by the advance of the Germans. There was a tribe of Boii in Cisalpine Gaul, probably kindred to these. See Introd., pp. 2, 3.
Noreiam: identified with the modern Neumarkt, in Styria. Near this town, in 113 b.c., the Cimbri defeated the Romans. See Introd., p. 5. —oppugnarant: for oppugnaverant.

The Helvetii could, no doubt, have marched northward ; but that would not have suited their purpose, and would have brought them into collision with the Germans. — unum: sc. iter. This ran westward along the right bank of the Rhone. The student while following the story should make constant use of the maps in this book.
qua : the adverb.
ducerentur: A. 537. 2; B. 284. 2; G. 631. 1 ; H. 591. 2; HB. 517. 2. The way was so narrow and difficult that only with great trouble could wagons be hauled over it one by one (in single file). A railway now follows this route from Geneva. The narrow part, where the Jura approaches the river, is called the Pas de l’Ecluse. — ut . . . possent: a clause of result.
alterum : the other. The Helvetii wished to follow this route, crossing to the left bank of the Rhone and passing through the territory of the Allobroges, just south of the river.

ante . . . Aprilis: an idiomatic expression, equivalent here to quintus dies ante Kalendas Aprilis. The nominal date is March 28, 58 b.c. (found by counting backward 5 days, beginning with April 1); but, as the calendar was in a very confused state, authorities differ nearly a month in their estimates of the real date. The estimate of the famous astronomer Leverrier is March 24, the date of the spring equinox of that year. — L. Pisone:

440. 3; HB. 355. Caesar’s barricade was not continuous, but was built only where the nature of the ground rendered it necessary. For
- five sixths of the entire distance the bank of the river is so steep that no defenses were needed. Where the slope was gentler, the bank was cut down perpendicularly, or nearly so, to the distance of sixteen feet from the top. The earth was thrown out to the side towards the river; this produced the effect of a trench. See the plan, p. 59.
castella: little fortresses, or redoubts, serving as rallying- places for the soldiers. See the illustration on p. 107. — quo facilius posset: in order that (lit. by which) more easily he might be able.

ulli: here equivalent to cuiquam. Notice that both quis- quam and ullus are regularly used only in negative sentences, or sentences implying a negative. See note on ullo, 1.1. — conentur: subj. of ind. disc. Caesar probably said Si vim facere conabimini, prohibebo. A. 516. i.a; B. 302. 1; G. 595 ; H. 574; HB. 579. a.

i.e. some tried to cross by bridges of boats and by rafts, others by fording at the shallow places. But the omission indicates that only a few tried to ford the river, while the main body tried to cross in the other ways. The word alii is in partitive apposition with Helvetii.
A. 282. a ; B. 169. 5; G. 322; H. 393. 4; HB. 319. I. a.—qua: the adverb.

IX. 5. Relinquebatur una via: observe the order of words; there was left (only) the one road. — Sequanis invitis : abi. abs., expressing a condition.
angustias: the Pas de l’Ecluse, nineteen Roman miles from Geneva; see note on p. 58, 1. 6. At this point the Sequani, if so disposed, could easily stop the progress of the Helvetii. — His . . . possent: not being able to persuade these by their own influence. The position of his emphasizes its connecting force. — sponte: see spontis in Vocab.
possent: cf. ubi . . . arbitrati sunt, p. 57, 1. 21. Notice that the indicative in temporal clauses expresses merely time; the subjunctive time and something else, here cause. A. 546; B. 288. 1;
579; H. 600. I. II. 1 ; HB. 525. Reread a few chapters of the text, noticing the force of moods in the temporal clauses. — Dumnorigem : cf. p. 56,1. 28.
deprecatore : abl. abs. with eo. Deprecator is a noun denoting the agent. A. 236. a; B. 147. 1 ; G. 181. 1 ; H.334; HB. 206. 1. The prefix de means away. The deprecator i prays away,’ or averts, something. In this case Dumnorix is to try to overcome the refusal of the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to pass. — impetrarent: the object is easily supplied.
gratia: on account of his personal popularity; abl. of cause. — plurimum: A. 390. c; B. 176. 2. b; G. 334; H. 409. 1 ; HB. 387. III.
in matrimonium duxerat: had tnarried. For the fact see p. 57,1. 1. To marry, said of the woman, is nubere. — cupiditate: for formation of the word cupiditas see A. 241 ; B. 149; G. 181. 2. b;
345; HB. 207. 2. — novis rebus: a change of governmetU. For case see A. 367; B. 187. II. a; G. 346; H. 426. 1 ; HB. 362. The adjective novus lacks a comparative.
quam plurimas . . . volebat: wished to have as many states as possible bound (to him) by his services. To have a thing bound easily passes into the meaning to have bound a thing. Thus arose the form of the perfect tense in English and other modern languages.

Sequani, Helvetii: in partitive apposition with the implied subject of dent. He causes them to exchange hostages, the Sequani pledging themselves not to obstruct the Helvetii, the Helvetii undertaking to pass through without doing any damage. The clauses ne . . . prohibeant and ut . . . transeant depend on obsides inter sese dent, which practically means agree. A. 563. d; B. 295. 4;

non longe : a glance at the map will show that the distance was fully 100 miles. In their old home the Helvetii were really nearer the province. They would be more dangerous, however, on the more exposed side of the province (locis patentibus maximeque frumentariis, 1. 22). — quae civitas: a tribe which. A. 307. e; B. 251. 4. b; G.616. 2\ H. 399. 3; HB. 327. Tolosa (Toulouse) was the chief city of the Tolosates.

Trans, he knew that if this happened (i.e. if the Helvetii reached the territory of the Santones), it would be very dangerous (with great danger) to the province to have (lit. that it would have), etc. Direct: Id si fiet, magno . . . erit (or futurum est) ut homines . . . habeat.

Segusiavos: these were clients of the Haedui. Caesar seems to have crossed the Rhone a little to the east of its junction with the Arar (Saone).
extra provinciam : Caesar undoubtedly here overstepped his authority. Outside of the Roman province, the Gallic tribes were independent of Roman rule. But the alliance of the Helvetii with the Sequani, who were friendly to the Germans, was a real menace to Roman influence in Gaul. The historian Livy represents the Helvetii as ready to march upon Narbo itself. See Introd., pp. 6-8.

pervenirent: for mood see note on dum, p. 59, 1. 8.
XII. 18. Flumen est Arar: there is a river, the Sadne. Most of the Haedui lived west of the river, and most of the Sequani east; but the words per finis show that the river was not absolutely a dividing line between the two tribes.
lenitate: abl. of manner. A. 412; B. 220. 1; G. 399; H. 473. 3; HB. 445. 3.

id flumen : A. 395 ; B. 179. 1 ; G. 331. R. 1 ; H. 413 ; HB. 386.
Ararim: with this accusative compare the ablative Arari, p. 62,1. 10. — de tertia vigilia : during the third watch, i.e. after the beginning of the third watch. The time from sunset to sunrise was divided into four equal watches, the length of which would of course vary with the season. In June the third watch, beginning at midnight, would extend to about two o’clock. — cum legionibus tribus: abl. of accompaniment. For formation of legio see note on munitioni, p. 60,1. 23.
castris: this camp was probably in the northern angle formed by the Rhone and Sa6ne.
impeditos: i.e. unable to defend themselves on account of their burdens and because they were engaged in crossing.
concidit: carefully distinguish the verbs concido, concido, and concedo, and notice the composition of each. Another account, probably incorrect, makes Labienus, not Caesar in person, the victor over the Tigurini. Labienus had been left in charge of the fortifications along the Rhone, but had probably rejoined Caesar before the battle. The place of this slaughter was probably a point about twelve miles above the junction of the Saone and Rhone. The rest of the Helvetii had crossed here, or a little farther north. — mandarunt: i.e. mandaverunt. Cf. oppugnarant, p. 58,1. 1.
in proximas silvas abdiderunt: notice the accusative silvas; they fled into the nearest woods and hid there. The sese of 1. 27 is object of abdiderunt as well as of mandarunt. — Is pagus: the word pagus, canton, is used of local divisions of territory and also of the inhabitants of the divisions.
30. patrum nostrorum memoria: in the time (lit. recollection) of our fathers. The year was 107 b.c. See Chap. VII and Introd., p. 5.

399. 3; HB. 284. 5. 6.
princeps poenaB persolvit: was the first to pay (paid first) the penalty. Persolvere means to pay to the uttermost. For the use of priiiceps see A. 290 ; B. 239 ; G. 325. r. 6; H. 497. 3 ; HB. 243.
Qua in re : and thereby.
eius soceri L. Pisonis avum: the grandfather of his (Caesar’s) father-in-law, Lucius Piso. See Introd., p. 11.THE HELVETIAN WAR
7. L. PiBonem . . . interfecerant: the Tigurini had killed Lucius Piso, the legate, in the same battle in which they had killed Cassius.
XIII. 9. reliquas copias Helvetiorum : notice the position of these words before the conjunction ut.
 faciendum curat: caused to be built. A. 500. 4; B. 337. 8. b. 2 (337. 7. b. 2) ; G. 430; H. 622; HB. 612. III.
exercitum: no doubt all six legions. The battle with the Tigurini had been fought with three.
cum. . .intellegerent: when they comprehended that he had done in o?ie day that which they had themselves accomplished only with the greatest difficulty in twenty days, namely the crossing of the river. The clause ut flumen transirent explains id quod confecerant, and hence takes the usual form of a substantive clause depending on conficio. A. 568; B. 297. I ; G. 553. 1 ; H. 566; HB. 521. 3. a. The great numbers of the Helvetii and their allies, and the large amount of baggage which they must have carried, rendered the movements of the host very slow.
cuius legationis : equivalent to quorum legatorum.
Cassiano: Caesar names the war from the general on the Roman side; cf. 1. 1. For the suffix -anus see A. 249. 2 ; B. 152. 1; G. 182. 5 ; H. 353 ; HB. 210. 5.
egit: parleyed; it is equivalent in this use to a verb of saying, and therefore introduces indirect discourse. Divico's speech extends to the end of the chapter. — Si . . . Helvetios: the direct form would be si faciet, ibunt atque erunt Helvetii. A. 589. 1. 2. a; B. 319. A. B; G. 656. 1.2; H. 646; HB. 534. 1. b. 2. II.
constituisset:	Divico	said	constitueris, fut. perf. This
sentence may be translated if the Roman people would make peace with the Helvetii, the Helvetii would go to that place and remain there, where Caesar (should have) settled them and (should have) wished them to be. — sin . . . reminisceretur: but if he persisted in pursuing them with war, he should remember; for the direct sin perseverabis, reminiscere (imperative). Sin is regularly used to introduce the second of two conditions opposed to each other. Notice the doubled per in persequi perseveraret.

As this is the first long passage of connected indirect discourse which the student has had in this book, he should study it carefully. Changing the indirect to the direct form is a very useful exercise in syntax and composition. Consult A. 590 for a treatment of this passage.
XIV. 28. His: sc. legatis. — Eo, quod: for this reason, (namely) because. Eo is abl. of degree, or measure, of difference, with minus, but almost equivalent to an abl. of cause. See note on hoc facilius, p. 56,1. 4. What is the subject of darit
eo . . . quo . . . accidissent: that he was the more indignant, the less they had happened in accordance (i.e. in proportion as they had not happened in accordance) with the deserts of the Roman people. In direct discourse this whoje sentence would run : Eo (or hoc) mihi minus dubitationis datur, quod eas (or has) res quas commemoravistis memoria teneo, atque eo (or hoc) gravius fero quo minus merito populi Romani acciderunt.

309. 3; G. 587; H. 598; HB. 526.

In a part of Caesar’s speech it is difficult to tell from the indirect form whether he spoke in the first person or not; vellet and eo% p. 63, 1. 2, and posse, p. 63, 1. 5, might refer to the Roman people rather than to Caesar. If the sentence is so understood, the use of eo is regular; but if it refers to Caesar, we should expect se. Caesar’s speech may be found given in direct discourse in G. 661;
institutos esse: cf. didicisse, p. 62,1. 24.

exercitatione : skill, the result of practice.
aciem : fierceness, or glare.
timor: a panic. A. 238. a; B. 147. 2; G. 181. 2. b; H. 333; HB. 206. 4.
non mediocriter: these words illustrate the figure called litotes, for which the grammar may be consulted. Use the index. — mentis animosque : minds and spirits. The Germans were less familiar, therefore more terrible, than the Gauls.
tribunis, praefectis: see Introd., pp. 33, 34. Many of these men, no doubt, belonged to families to which Caesar was in debt, pecuniarily or politically. Those who owed their appointment to this were naturally of small use from a military point of view. — reliquis : young men who accompanied Caesar in order to gain some military experience under an able general, or to see what life in the field was. They were called contubernales (‘ tent- companions ’) of the general.
22. quorum . . . inlata: of these one giving one reason, another another. For alius alia see A. 315. c; B. 253. 2; G. 221. r. i ; H. 516. 1; HB. 279. 3. — quam . . . diceret: which he said made it necessary for him to set out. What is the literal translation? For mood of diceret cf. existimarent, p. 68,1. 29.
pudore: a sense of shame. — ut . . . vitarent: a clause of purpose, depending on remanebant.
vultum fingere: i.e. so as to conceal their fear.
tabernaculis: see Introd., pp. 41, 43.
suum : emphatic, contrasted with commune.
totis castris : throughout the camp. A. 429. 2 ; B. 228. I. b;
388; H. 485. 2; HB. 436. a.—testamenta: not verbal wills, which, when made just before a battle, had binding force, but regularly attested documents.
30. centuriones: see Introd., p. 33.—quique: and those who.
Digitized by GOOgle	UNIVERSITY	OF	CALIFORNIAI THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST ARIOVISTUS 295
31. perturbabantur: were gettingfrightened; observe the tense. — ex his : equivalent to a genitive.
33. ipsos: could se have been used here?
1. rem frumentariam: obj. of timere. We should expect a nominative, subject of posset. — ut . . . posset: A. 564; B. 296.2 ;
550. 2 ; H. 567. 1 ; HB. 502. 4. Trans, ut by that . . . not.
castra . . . ferri: the expression castra mo'itere means to break camp; signa ferre, to bear on the standards, i.e. to march. During a halt the standards were set up in the earth. — dicto: dat. with audientis, which here means obedietit. A. 367; B. 187. II. a; G.
/	346.	N. 5 ; H. 426. 1 ; HB. 362.
laturos: this sentence in the direct form would run, Cum . . . iusseris, non erunt dicto audientes milites neque . . . ferent.
This description of the panic and the speech given in the next chapter, by which Caesar checked it, are admirable examples of Caesar’s literary skill.
XL. 5. omnium ordinum: of all the centuries. See Introd., p. 31. To a council of war only the centurions primorum ordinum (see Introd., p. 34) were usually summoned. Caesar now wishes, through the centurions, to reach the whole army as effectively as possible.
incusavit: blamed, or reproached.
sibi . . . putarent: they thought it incumbent on themselves to ask or consider. What literally?
putarent: subj. because it gives the reason of Caesar the speaker as reported by Caesar the writer. — Ariovistum : subject of appetisse. See note on beneficio, p. 75, 1. 11.
cur quisquam iudicaret: why should any one think ? A negative answer is implied. For the subjunctive, which was subjunctive in the direct form as well, see A. 444, 587; B. 277, 315. 3 ;
259, 651. r. 2; H. 557, 642. 3; HB. 513. 1.
Sibi quidem persuaderi: for his part, he was becoming convinced, more literally to him at least it was being proved. Notice the impersonal use of a verb which takes the dative. i I' am becoming convinced1 is mihi persuadetur. See note on minus . . . posset, p. 77,1. 25.
eum: Ariovistus. The clause eum . . . repudiaturum is subject oipersuaderi.
intulisset: intulerit in the direct form.—quid tandem vererentur: what in the world should they be afraid oft See note on 1. 10.
sua: vestra in the direct form. It refers to the army, whichpage	Caesar is addressing through its representatives. —ipsius : refers to
79	Caesar himself. A. 300. b; B. 249. 3; G. 660. 5; H. 509. 6; HB.
263. 2.
Factum: sc. esse. Notice the emphatic position of the word. — periculum: trial. The root is the same that appears in the verb experior.
Cimbris : cf. Chap. XXXIII, and see Introd., pp. 4-6.
meritus videbatur: was seen to have earned. We should expect here the subjunctive of indirect discourse, but the indicative is used to emphasize the statement as a fact. The statement seems artfully thrown in as a hint to the army to be equally deserving of praise. For Caesar’s relation to Marius see Introd., p. 8.
nuper: more recently.—servili tumultu: abl. of time. The Servile War against Spartacus and his gladiators was in 73-71 b.c. These gladiators were largely German slaves. Tumultus was the word applied to any uprising in Italy or Cisalpine Gaul. — quos: the antecedent is servorum, implied in servili. A. 306. b; B. 250. 4; G. 614. R. 3. a; H. 399. 4; HB. 325. — tamen: i.e. though they were defeated, yet they were helped somewhat by the training which they had received at our hands.
usus ac disciplina : experience (from practice) and training (from a teacher).
Ex quo: from this. Though introduced by a relative, this is practically an independent sentence; hence posse, not posset, in indirect discourse. A. 583. b; B. 314. 4; G. 635;
643. 1; HB. 535. 1. b. — quantum boni: how much (of) value. — haberet: trans, has, not had. In Latin such expressions of a general, or permanent, truth usually conform to the law of sequence of tenses.
inermis : at the outbreak of the insurrection the arms of the slaves were of the most primitive kind.
24. quibuscum congressi superarint: quibuscum goes with congressi, and the object of superarint is to be supplied; but we may translate whom the Helvetii had often met and vanquished. Observe the tense of superarint (superaverint) and pottierint. In the next sentence Caesar returns to the regular sequence.
exercitui: A. 384; B. 192. 1; G.359; H. 434. 2; HB. 362. The Helvetii had defeated the Germans, the Romans had overcome the Helvetii. The inference is obvious.
adversum proelium : the battle at Magetobriga; see p. 74,
11, and Introd., p. 7.—hos . . . posse: in the direct form hi, si quaerent, reperire possunt.THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST ARIOVISTUS 297
defatigatis Gallis: abi. abs., expressing time and cause.
cum se tenuisset . . . fecisset: after keeping himself and giving them no chance at him. — castris : abl. of place. The preposition is not used, because the ablative is one of means as well as place.
sui: for gen. see A. 348; B. 200; G. 363. 2; H. 440. 2 ; HB. 354. — desperantis . . . vicisse: having attacked them suddenly, when they were now despairing of a battle and scattered, had overcome them more by ruse and strategy than by valor.
32. Cui rationi, hac : equivalent to hac ratione cui. The antecedent is attracted into the relative clause. Translate the sentence, Not even Ariovistus himself hoped that our armies could be caught by this ruse, for which there had been a place in fighting against unskilled barbarians.
1. Qui . . . conferrent: those who ascribed their fear to a pretended anxiety regarding supplies, etc. The antecedent of qui is the subject offacere, eos understood.
3. officio : discharge of his duty.
frumenta: how does this differ in meaning from frumentum ?
Quod . . . dicantur: as to the fact that it was said they would not be obedient to command or mo7>e forward. See note on p. 62,1.20. See also A. 582 ; B. 332. c; G. 528; H. 611; HB. 590. 1. Notice here again the primary tense.
nihil: not at all. A. 390. c. N. 2 ; B. 176. 3. a; G. 334. R. 1;
416. 2; HB. 387. III.
scire: sc. se. — quibuscumque . . . defuisse: whomever an army had not obeyed, either fortune had failed (these) because the campaign had been baddy conducted.
avaritiam esse convictam: greed had been proved (against them). The meaning of the sentence is, if any generals have found their armies disobedient, the reason is that the generals have been unlucky in war or have been proved guilty of dishonesty.— innocentiam: integrity.
perpetua vita: throughout his whole life. — felicitatem: goodfortune, luck, as a personal quality.
quod . . . fuisset: what he had intended to postpone to a later day.
de quarta vigilia: see note on p. 61,1. 24.
quamprimum :* as soon as possible. — utrum . . . valeret:
A. 334, 335; B- 162. 4; G. 458, 460; H. 380; HB. 234.
 officium: sense of duty. — Quod si . . . iturum: in the direct discourse quod si .. . sequetur, tamen ego . . . ibo.
Digitized by GOOgleNOTES
17. praetoriani cohortem: bodyguard, composed of the best soldiers, and receiving many marks of favor from the general.
This speech deserves to be carefully studied as a specimen of oratory. Caesar was ranked by the Romans second only to Cicero among their orators. As a general he relied much on his power of persuasion. This speech produced an instantaneous effect, as is seen in the next chapter.
XLI. 20. conversae sunt: were transformed.
inlata eat: was inspired'.— princeps gratias egit: was foremost in expressing thanks. A. 290; B. 239; G. 325. r. 6;
497. 3; HB. 243.
quod . . . fecisset: because he had expressed a most favorable opinion about it.
cum tribunis egerunt: i.e. begged the tribunes.—primorum Ordinum: see Introd., p. 34.
uti Caesari satisfacerent: obj. of egerunt.
summa belli: the conduct of the war.—suum : predicate of iudicium, which is subject of esse.
itinere exquisito per Diviciacum: having sought out a route thrqugh the help of Diviciacus.—quod . . . habebat: because of the Gauls he had most faith in him. For the dative ei see note on cui, p. 66,1. 34.
ut . . . duceret: that he might lead his army through open country, by a detour of more than fifty miles. Thus Caesar avoided the angustiae itineris of which the soldiers were afraid. The case of milium is not affected by the comparative amplius. A. 407. c; B. 217. 3 ; G. 296. R. 4; H. 471. 4; HB. 416. d. Instead of marching northeasterly from Besan^on directly up the valley of the Doubs, Caesar made a detour to the north and east. Then he entered the valley of the Rhine through the pass between the Jura and the Vosges mountains. He thus avoided the difficulties of the Doubs valley and the Jura range.
33. milia: acc. of extent of space. Probably Caesar had reached the Fecht, between Ostheim and Gemar.
XLII. 2. Quod: the rel. pron., obj. of postulasset. Its antecedent is id, subject offieri. What is the subject of licere f — per se: so far as he was concerned.
4. condicionem: proposal.
7. denegasset: had utterly refused.
9. pro : in gratitude for.
fore uti desisteret: he would cease, more literally it would come to pass that he would cease. A. 569. a; B. 270. 3. a; G. 248; H. 619. 2 ; HB. 472. c.

13. conloquio : for a conference,	page
17. postulavit: notice the form of the two demands following 81 this verb, each expressed by the subjunctive, and each having an explanatory clause with the accusative and infinitive appended to it.
22. veniret: this may be taken as a substantive clause, like ne . . . adduceret. But it is better to regard it as simply the indirect form of uterque veniat} let each come. — alia ratione: on any other terms.
tolli: to be prevented.
Gallorum equitatui: see Introd., p. 37.
Gallis equitibus: dat., though translated with from. A.
381 ; B. 188. 2. d; G. 345; H. 427; HB. 371. Caesar had about 4000 horsemen.
eo: thereon, i.e. on them.—legionarios : A. 250. a; B. 151.2 ;
189. 45; H. 348; HB. 210. 1. The word is contrasted with equitibus. See Introd., p. 34.
imponere: subject of esse, 1. 29. — si . . . esset: if there should be any need of action. For the construction with opus see A. 411.a; B. 218. 2. c; G. 406; H. 477. Ill; HB. 430. 1. 2. b.
non inridicule: not without wit, a case of litotes.
1. pollicitum . . . rescribere: having promised (merely) that	82
he would have the tenth legion as his body-guard, he was (actually) enrolling them among the equites. The joke lies in the double meaning of the word equites, which was the name of an order of nobility at Rome, below the senatorial rank. Perhaps the double meaning of ad equum rescribere may be expressed by the English ‘ to invest with spurs.’
XLIH. c. Eo: i.e. ad tumulum.
equis: abl. of means, but trans, on horseback. — passibus:
A. 425. b; B. 223 ; G. 403; H. 417. 3, 479. 3; HB. 424. The ablative is connected with ab, i.e. away by two hundred paces.
ex equis: on horseback. Cf. ex vinculis, p. 57, 1. 10.
denos: ten apiece, a distributive numeral.
munera: probably such things as the Romans once sent to another foreign king, — a curule chair, a golden crown, costly clothing, etc. — quam rem : a thing which, subject of contigisse and consuesse.
officiis: services.
cum: though. — aditum: right of approach.
haberet: A. 549; B. 309. 3; G. 587; H. 598; HB. 525.

appetissent: subj. of ind. disc.	,
ut . . . esse : to wish its allies and friends not only to lost nothing of their own, but e7>en to be increased in influence, dignity, and honor. The clause explains consuetudinem.
23. quod . . . posset: and indeed who could suffer that to be taken away from them which they had brought to the friendship of the Roman people f Caesar refers to the independence of the Haedui and their influence among the Gauls. The direct form of the question was quis possit?
25. ne bellum inferret: that he should not make war. In the direct form this clause would be a prohibition. How are prohibitions expressed?
28. quos transire pateretur: allow any to cross. A. 563. c;
B. 331. Ill; G. 553. 2. N.; H. 614; HB. 587.
XLIV. 30. sese : subject of transisse and three other infinitives. This passage is given in the direct form in G. 661. 1; H. 653.
rogatum : cf. P* 73> 1- 15-
3. obsides : obj. of habere.
victis imponere: to impose on the vanquished.—sese Gallis, Gallos sibi: the chiastic order. See note on p. 60,
14.
ad se oppugnandum: to attack him; the gerundive construction, expressing purpose.
8. uno proelio: the battle ad Magetobrigam. Cf. p. 74,1.11. — Si . . . decertare: if they wished to try again, he was ready to fight it out again. In the direct form, Si iterum experiri volunt, ego iterum paratus sum decertare.
de stipendio recusare: to make excuses about paying tribute, i.e. refuse to pay. — quod : the relative.
pependerint: from pendo, not pendeo.
Amicitiam esse oportere: friendship ought to be; but remember that oportere is impersonal, and hence amicitiam is subject of esse, not of oportere.—sibi ornamento: A. 382. 1; B. 191. 2;
G. 356; H. 433; HB. 360. b.
14. remittatur: should be reinitted. The power of exacting tribute would be lost if the Haeduan hostages were returned, as Caesar demanded.I THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST ARIOVISTUS 301
appetierit: appetii in the direct discourse. — Quod: see note on p. 62, 1. 20.
id: refers to the preceding clause. — sui muniendi causa:
to protect himself.
quod . . . venerit: that he did not come without being asked. The clause is subject of esse, testimonium being predicate.
defenderit: repelled.
Galliae provinciae: see Introd., p. 23.
Quid sibi vellet: direct, Quid tibi vis ? What are your intentions f A. 586; B. 315.1 ; G. 651 ; H. 642 ; HB. 534. 2. Ill, 537.
Provinciam . . . nostram: this (part of) Gaul was his province,just as that was ours.
Ut . . . interpellaremus: direct, Ut mihi concedi non oportet, si in vestros finis impetum faciam, sic item vos estis iniqui, quod in meo hire me interpellatis, i.e. as no concession ought to be made to me, etc. Up to this point dependent subjunctives in this speech have been either present or perfect; we now have also imperfects and pluperfects.
tam imperitum rerum : so ignorant of the course of events. A. 349- a; B. 204. 1; G. 374; H. 451. 15 HB- 354-
ut non sciret: as not to know, a clause of result.—bello proximo : abl. of time.
ipsos : i.e. Haeduos.
auxilio: abl. with usos esse.
Debere . . . habere: he had good reason to suspect that although Caesar pretended friendship, he had the army which he had in Gaul for the purpose of crushing him. The subject of habere is Caesarem.
34. Qui nisi : so unless he.
Quod : and as to that, referring to the previous sentence.
gratum esse facturum : he would confer a favor, lit. do a pleasing thing. Caesar had many enemies in Rome, and these were no idle words.

been in favor before.

quaecumque bella: subject of geri. In the direct discourse, quaecumque bella geri voles sine ullo tuo labore et periculo conficiam.
XLV. 9. in eam sententiam, quare: to this effect (namely to show), why.
pati : its subject is consuetudinem, its object uti . . . desereret. We had pati followed by acc. and inf. on p. 82, 1. 24. — optime meritos: most deserving.
neque . . . Romani: and he thought Gaul did not belong to Ariovistus more than to the Roman people.
superatos esse: in 121 b.c.
quibus . . . ignovisset: but the Roman people had pardoned them. Why is quibus dative? — in provinciam redegisset: reduced into a province, under a Roman governor. The Cdvennes lay between these tribes and the Roman province, so that it would have been hard to incorporate them with the latter.
si . . . oporteret: if priority of time {each most ancient time) ought to be considered.
iustissimum: most valid. — imperium: right of rule.
quam: subject of uti.
victam: though conquered.—suis legibus uti: i.e. to be independent.
XLVI. 20. geruntur: were going on. Account for the tense.
tumulum: A. 432. a; B. 141. 3; G. 416. 22; H. 420. 5; HB. 380. b.
loquendi: on p. 75,1. 12, finem facere is used with a dative.
ne quod telum reicerent: not to throw back any weapon. The form quod is adjective, quid generally substantive.
26. ut . . . posset . . . circumventos: subject of committendum. Trans, that, after the enemy were defeated, it could be alleged that they had been deceived by him in the conference through their (misplaced) confide?ice. As Caesar takes victory for granted, it is better not to regard pulsis hostibus as conditional.
qua adrogantia . . . interdixisset: with what arrogance (lit. having used what arrogance) in the conference Ariovistus had ordered the Romans out of (forbidden the Romans from) all Gaul.
Gallia: abl. of separation. — Romanis: dat., depending on interdixisset.—interdixisset: subj. in an ind. quest. — ut: how.
diremisset: had broken off. Caesar labors earnestly to make his acts appear justifiable, and in a certain sense they were so. Gaul had to be either Romanized or Germanized, and there can be no doubt which was the better for the country at that time.

XLVII. 1. Biduo post: next day, lit. two days after. Cf. pridie eius diei, 1. 6. The Romans counted the day from which, as well as the day to which, they reckoned.—legatos misit: this expression implies both ‘to say’ and ‘to ask.1 On the former idea depends the following clause with the acc. and inf., on the latter idea the clause beginning with uti.
coeptae: for the voice see A. 205. a; B. 133. 1; G. 423. n. 3; H. 299. 1; HB. 199. 2.
agere cum eo: to treat with him.
si id minus vellet: if he hardly wished (to do) that. — ex suis legatis: of his legates. A. 346. c; B. 201. 1. a; G. 372. R. 2;
444; HB. 346. e.
eo magis : all the more.
pridie eius diei: see note on postridie eius diei, p. 68,1. 22. — quin conicerent: from hurling. A. 558; B. 295.3. a; G. 555. 1; H. 595. 2; HB. 502. 3. b.
Legatum: obj. of missurum and obiecturum.
9. Commodissimum visum est: it seemed most fitting. ■ The subject of visum est is mittere.
10. humanitate: culture.
u. Flacco: Valerius Flaccus was governor of Gaul in 83 b.c. Notice that Procillus took the nomen and praenomen of the man from whom he received the honor of citizenship. For Roman names see A. 108; B. 373; G. page 493; H. 354; HB. 678. — civitate donatus erat: had been presented with (Roman) citizenship. A. 364; B. 187. I. a; G. 348; H. 426.6; HB. 365. b.—propter fidem: this phrase, propter . . . scientiam, and the clause quod . . . esset give the reasons why it seemed best to send Procillus.
multa: agrees with qua, but is nearly equivalent to an adverb with utebatur, i.e. spoke freely.
longinqua consuetudine: abl. of cause. — quod . . .esset: because in his case the Germans (Germanis is dat. of poss.) had no reason for doing wrong. Procillus was a Gaul, not a Roman. Why is esset subjunctive? Remember that Caesaris describing his own previous acts as if those of another person.
una: sc. cum eo, along with him.
hospitio Ariovisti utebatur : enjoyed guest friendship with Ariovistus. Hospitium was a very sacred relationship, and might be hereditary. See note on p. 73, 1. 23. — quae diceret Ariovistus : ind. quest.
18. Quid: whyt A. 390. c. N. 2; B. 176. 3. a; G. 333. 1. r. 2; H. 416. 2 ; HB. 388. a. N. — An speculandi causa : or (was it) for

85	HB. 237. — Conantis: sc. eos.	Ariovistus wished his army to
regard Procillus and Metius not as envoys, but as spies. Therefore he prevented them from speaking.
XLVIII. 20. milibus : see note on passibus, p. 82,1. 6.
ultra eum : i.e. in the direction from which Caesar had come. This was apparently an excellent manoeuver. See the plan, p. 87.
qui: agrees with its nearest antecedent.
continuos : in succession.
aciem instructam habuit: kept his army drawn up in line of battle.—ut . . . deesset: that, if Ariovistus had a desire to fight a battle, he might have the chance. We have ut non instead of tie, because the negative is closely connected with the verb.
castris: see note on p. 79, 1. 29.
se exercuerant: had trained themselves, i.e. had become expert.
31. quos . . . delegerant: whom the horsemen had selected for their own protection from the whole number (of foot-soldiers), one apiece. Each 4 knight1 had his 4 squire.’
88	2.	si quid erat durius : if there was any unusual difficulty.
si qui: the indefinite pronoun, of which quis is the regular substantive form in the masculine nominative singular.
si . . . prodeundum: if it was necessary to go forward rather far to any place. Si quo is the adverb of si quis, just as quo of quis or qui.
6. equorum: to be taken with both iubis and cursum. Running along by the horses and holding on by their manes, they could keep up with them. Caesar afierwards used these cavalry tactics.
XLIX. 7. eum : subject of tenere, and refers to Ariovistus. — ne . . . prohiberetur: a clause of purpose, depending on delegit and venit. Cf. p. 85, 1. 23.
loco: Caesar uses the word locus five times in the first six lines of this chapter. In the previous chapter he uses castra four times in four lines. It is said that Macaulay never hesitated to repeat a noun, if by so doing he could express his meaning more clearly than by using a pronoun.
castris: for a camp. — idoneum: for its comparison see A. 128; B. 74. 2; G. 87. 6; H. 159; HB. 121.
acie triplici: see Introd., p. 44.
expedita: agrees grammatically with milia, but logically with hominum. The word means unencumbered, hence ready to fight. See Introd., p. 40.
Original from DIVERSITY OF CALIFTHE CAMPAIGN AGAINST ARIOVISTUS 305
quae . . . prohiberent: a rel. clause of purpose.
Nihilo : abl. of degree, or measure, of difference.

18. quattuor reliquas: there were, then, six in all. See In- trod., p. 36, and cf. Chap. X. — castra maiora: Caesar’s piain camp, where he had been for nearly two weeks. The two camps were about two and one-half miles apart, with the camp of Ariovistus between them. See the plan, p. 87. What was the obvious purpose of Caesar’s smaller camp ?
Ii.	19. instituto suo: in accordance with his plan. See note on ?;ioribus suis, p. 57,1. 9.
21. pugnandi potestatem fecit: offered battle.
inlatis: inflicted.
proelio decertaret: fight it out in a (pitched) battle. — quod . . . esset: a substantive clause explaining hanc.

sortibus: Tacitus describes the sortes of the Germans. Twigs with certain marks made upon them, scattered over a white cloth, were drawn by him who consulted the lots. The marks were then interpreted.—vaticinationibus: perhaps prophecies uttered by women thought to be inspired.
necne: A. 335. N.; B. 300. 4. a; G. 459; H. 650. 1 : HB. 234. a. — fas : divine will.
novam lunam: this new moon fell on Sept. 18. Days of new and full moon were of good omen. The Spartans would not send aid to the Athenians at Marathon before the full moon.
LI. 2. alarios: auxiliaries. See Introd., p. 37. The word alarius means belonging to the wings, where the auxiliaries were usually stationed in battle.
pro: in proportion to, in co?nparison with. —ad speciem: for show. Caesar wished Ariovistus to think that these auxiliaries were legionaries.
generatim : by tribes.
Bo: i.e. in raedas et carros. These were probably set in a great semicircle, inclosing the rear and flanks.
passis: from pando.
LH. 14. legatos et quaestorem: Caesar had six legions, so probably he had only five legati. Later he had ten. See Introd.,
15. suae quisque virtutis : notice the order of words, which is regular.

signo dato: i.e. by a trumpet. See Introd., p. 39.
ut: correlative with ita.—pila: obj. of the gerund con- iciendi. What other construction might have been used ? A. 503 ; B. 339. 1; G. 427; H. 626. 1 ; HB. 613.
phalange facta: see note on phalange, p. 69, 1. 10.
insilirent: subj. of characteristic.—desuper: i.e. over the rim. The usual practice of the Roman soldier was to push the enemy’s shield upward with his own, and thrust underneath.
sinistro cornu : the left wing of the German army.
adulescens: perhaps Crassus was distinguished by this word from his elder brother, mentioned in Bk. V as Caesar’s legate and in Bk. VI as quaestor; or from his father, M. Crassus, the triumvir. — expeditior : freer. The cavalry was chiefly for pursuit after the battle.
tertiam aciem : this had been kept in reserve until now.
LIII. 30. proelium restitutum est: the tide of battle was
turned.
prius quam pervenerunt: cf. priusquam conaretur, p. 66,
31, and the note. For the moo$ of pervenerunt see A. 551. a; B. 291. 2; G. 574; H. 605. 1; HB. 561. — fugere: A. 456; B. 328. 1 ; G. 423. 2; H. 607. 1 ; HB. 586. a.
milia passuum quinque : if this battle was fought between Ostheim and Gemar, on the left bank of the Fecht, the distance to the Rhine at its nearest point was twelve or fifteen miles, and quinque must be an error. Some authorities think that Caesar mistook the 111 for the Rhine. The date of the battle was about Sept. 14.
viribus: A. 431; B. 219. 1; G. 401. N. 6; H. 476. 3; HB. 437.

whether.
sortium beneficio: the lots had decided that he should be reserved.
This defeat of the Germans on what was practically their own ground insured the Roman supremacy in Gaul.

HB. 380. b. Cf. tumulum, p. 84,1. 21.
maximis bellis: a powerful blow had been struck at free Gaul in the victory over the Helvetii, and the onward march of the Germans had been checked by the victory over Ariovistus. These victories had been won by a man of middle age, whose previous military experience had been comparatively slight.
hiberna: sc. castra, winter quarters. See Introd., p. 43.
— in Sequanos: among the Sequani. Notice that both hiberna and Sequanos take the construction of end, or limit, of motion.
hibernis : dat. — Labienum: see Introd., p. 32. — citeriorem Galliam: see Introd., p. 21.
conventus: the courts of justice presided over by the governor of a province. Caesar wished to be nearer Rome, the better to look after his political interests there.
BOOK II
I. 1. Cum esset Caesar: while Caesar was. The use of the 90 subjunctive with cu?n in temporal clauses emphasizes the circumstances rather than the time. In this case the point of importance is that Caesar was not in Transalpine Gaul at the time when he received the reports. A. 545, 546; B. 288. 1; G. 579, 585;
H. 600. II. 1; HB. 524, 550. a.—citeriore Gallia: see Introd., p. 21. Here Caesar usually spent his winters while governor of Gaul. See note at end of Bk. I. For comparison of citerior see A. 130. a; B. 73. 1; G. 87. 2. 7; H. 155. 1 ; HB. 123. For declension of comparatives see A. 120; B. 69; G. 89; H. 127; HB. 116.
— supra: at the end of Bk. I. See Introd., p. 12, for a brief summary of Bk. I.
Digitized by Googleadferebantur: notice the tense; kept coming, lit. were (continually) being brought. A. 470; B. 260. 2; G. 231 ; H. 534. 3; HB. 484.—litteris: by despatches; see Vocab. For case see A. 409; B. 218; G. 401; H.476; HB. 423.
Labieni: see Introd., p. 32. — certior: see certus in Vocab.
fiebat: A. 204; B. 131 ; G. 173; H. 296; HB. 195.—Belgas: subject of coniurare and dare. A. 397. e; B. 184; G. 343. 2; H. 415; HB. 398.—quam: subject of esse. Its antecedent is Belgas, but it agrees in number and gender with partem. A. 306; B. 250.3:
614. R. 3. b; H. 396. 2 ; HB. 326. 1. —tertiam Galliae partem: see Bk. I, Chap. I, and Introd., p. 23. These words, with esse, form the predicate of quam.
dixeramus: i.e. before we began to write the present narrative about them.—coniurare, dare : these are the verbs of a sentence in indirect discourse depending on rumores adferebantur and certior fiebat. Trans, that all the Belgae were conspiring . . . and giving. To express the same thought in the direct discourse, change the accusative to a nominative and the infinitive to an indicative, i.e. omnes Belgae coniurant . . . dant. Similarly quam . . . partem above becomes quae tertia est Galliae pars. A. 578, 579, 580: B. 3*3> 331- 1; G. 508. 2, 527; H. 613, 641, 642; HB. 589. 591.
inter se: to one another. A. 301. f; B. 245. 1 ; G. 221;
502. 1; HB. 266. — Coniurandi : gen. of gerund, depending on causas. A. 504; B. 338. 1; G. 428; H. 626; HB. 612. 1. Any movement against the Roman power was, in Caesar’s eyes, a conspiracy. — has esse causas: that these were the reasons; in the 1 direct form, hae sunt causae.
quod vererentur: if this were Caesar’s statement, we should have verebantur. The subjunctive shows that it is part of the information he received. A. 580; B. 314. 1 ; G. 508.2; H. 643; HB. I 534.2.—ne . . . adduceretur: after expressions denoting fear we find ne with the subjunctive if it is wished that a thing may not happen, ut or ne non if it is wished that a thing may happen. A. 564; B. 296. 2; G. 550; H. 567; HB. 502. 4. The rule for sequence determines the tense. A. 483 ; B. 267. 2 ; G. 509; H. 543 ; HB. 476.
Gallia: by this is meant the division inhabited by the Celtae, or Galli. See Introd., p. 23. Trans, after all Gaul had been fubdud {renderedpeacef ul). Since the ablative absolute is used much more frequently in Latin than the nominative absolute in English, the nominative absolute should seldom be used in translating it. A. 420. N.; B. 227. 2 ; G. 410; H. 489.. 1 ; HB. 421.THE WAR WITH THE BELGAE
non nullis: some. — sollicitarentur: see note on quod vererentur, 1. 6.
partim . . . ferebant: partly those (i.e. by some) who, (Just) as they had been unwilling that the Germans should continue longer in Gaul, so were indignant that an army, etc. — diutius: A. 218. a; B. 77. 1; G. 93; H. 311. 4; HB. 129. — versari: A. 563. b; B. 331. IV; G. 532; H. 614; HB. 587. The reference is to the hordes of Germans under Ariovistus whom Caesar had driven from Gaul the previous year. — noluerant: this and the following indicatives show that Caesar is not now quoting the information given by Labienus.
exercitum . . . inveterascere: this depends on moleste ferebant. A. 572. b; B. 331. V; G. 533; H. 614; HB. 594.
partim qui: these make a second division of the Gallis of 1. 7. The non nullis of 1. 11 form a third division.—mobilitate . . . animi: on account of changeableness and fickleness of fiurpose. vA. 404; B. 219; G. 408; H. 475; HB. 444. The restlessness of the Gauls (often mentioned by Caesar) rendered them particularly susceptible to the influence of party leaders, some of whom no doubt were actuated by motives purely patriotic. — novis imperiis: a revolution. What literally? For case see A. 367; B. 187. II. a; G. 346; H. 426. 1; HB. 362.
a potentioribus : abl. of agent, depending on occupabantur. A.405; B. 216; G.401; H.468; HB.406. 1. Find other instances of the construction in this chapter.
conducendos: a gerundive agreeing with homines. Trans, the phrase for hiring men. A. 503 ; * B. 339. 2 ; G. 427 ; H. 628 ; HB. 613. 1.
regna occupabantur: royal power was seized (usurped). The plural helps to show that there were many instances. — qui: and these men.—minus: A. 218. a; B. 77. 1; G. 93 ; H. 311.2; HB. 129. — rem: thing is usually inadequate as a translation of res. Since the reference is to regna occupabantur, we may here say usurpation.
imperio nostro: under our government.
H. 15. commotus: because he was disturbed. The participle is widely used in Latin, and English participles must be employed less frequently in translating. Notice the agreement of every Latin participle you meet, and consider its meaning carefully before trying to render it.— duas : A. 134. b; B. 80. 2; G. 95; H. 166; HB. 131. 2.
16. conscripsit: Caesar already had six legions. See Introd.,

pp. 31, 36. —inita aestate: in the beginning of summer, lit. summer having been entered.—in ulteriorem Galliam: see Introd., p. 23. Connect the phrase with deduceret.
qui deduceret: A. 531. 2; B. 282. 2; G. 545; H. 590; HB. 502. 2. Here, as often, the infinitive gives the best English rendering of the clause of purpose. — cum . . . inciperet: as soon as there began to be a supply of fodder. See note on cum esset, 1. 1. Notice that there is in the original no equivalent of the word 4 there,’ sometimes used in English to introduce a verb. What is the subject of inciperet ?
Dat: historical present, very common in Latin. A. 469; B. 259. 3; G. 229; H. 532. 3; HB. 491. 1.
Senonibus: where situated ? The maps in this book should be regularly consulted. The word is in the dative case, indirect object of dat.—reliquis Gallis: we say the rest of the Gauls, but observe that reliquis is an adjective. A. 293; B. 253. 5; G. 291. R. 2; H. 497. 4; HB. 279. 1. b. — Belgis: A. 384; B. 192. 1; G. 359; H. 434. 2; HB. 362.
uti . . . cognoscant: A. $63; B. 295. 1; G. 546; H. 564. I; HB. 502. 3. a. The phrase negotium dare is equivalent to a verb of commanding. We may translate he charges the Senones to learn, lit. he gives the task to the Senones that they learn, — gerantur: A. 593; B. 324. 1 ; G. 629; H. 652; HB. 539.
certiorem faciant: cf. certior fiebat, 1. 3.—constanter: consistently; their stories 1 stood together.’—manus . . . conduci: indirect discourse; direct, manus coguntur, exercitus . .. conducitur.
dubitandum: gerundive; sc. esse, the two words together making the infinitive of the so-called passive periphrastic conjugation. It is here used impersonally in indirect discourse depending on existimavit. Trans. thought he ought not to hesitate, lit. thought that it was not to be hesitated (by himself). A. 196, 208. d; B. 115, 138. IV; G. 251. 1.2; H. 237, 302. 7; HB. 162, 201. c.
quin proficisceretur: to set out. It depends on dubitandum. Non dubito regularly takes quin and the subjunctive when it means I do not doubt; when it means I do not hesitate, it regularly takes the infinitive.
castra movet: the army had been wintering among the Sequani, probably at Vesontio. — xv: read it quindecim. Caesar’s eight legions, with auxiliaries and cavalry, may have amounted to from 40,000 to 50,000 men.
IH. i. Eo : the adverb. — celerius: how is this compared ? — omnium opinione : than any one expected. A. 406. a; B. 217. 4;
Original from UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIATHE WAR WITH THE BELGAE
398. N. r; H. 471. 8 ; HB. 416. e. Notice the order of words in this phrase. Adjectives and genitives normally follow the noun they modify, but may be made emphatic by being put before it. So on p. 90,1. 3, omnis Belgas, ‘ all the Belgae ’; p. 90,1. 10, novis imperiis, ‘ new governments.’ The student should notice instances of the application of this principle as he reads.
Remi: their chief town was Durocortorum, the modern Rheims.—Galliae: see note on Gallia, p. 90, 1. 6. For case cf. Belgis, p. 90,1. 19. — ex Belgis : takes the place of a partitive genitive, or genitive of the whole. A. 346. c; B. 201. 1. a; G. 372. R. 2;
444; HB. 346. e.
qui dicerent: see note on qui deduceret, p. 90,1. 17.
se suaque: the -que shows that se as well as sua is object ofpermittere. The subject of an infinitive in indirect discourse is usually expressed, but it would be awkward to have another se as the subject of permittere. The indirect discourse extends to the end of the chapter.
coniurasse : for coniuravisse. A. 181. a; B. 116.1; G. 131.1; H. 43. 1; HB. 163. 1.
dare : the first of four infinitives limiting paratos. —facere : to obey, lit. to do, or execute.— oppidis: the omission of the preposition is due to the fact that the ablative expresses means as well as place.
incolant: this might have been incolerent, since miserunt, the main verb of the sentence introducing the indirect discourse, is in a secondary, or historical, tense. A. 585. b. n. ; B. 318; G. 654. n. ; H. 644. 1; HB. 478.
tantum: the predicate offurorem; so great was the infatuation. It is correlative to ut, which introduces the verb potuerint, subjunctive of result. A. 537. N. 2; B. 284. 1; G. 552 (under 3) ; H. 570; HB. 521. 2. a.—ne quidem: that which is emphasized by these two words always stands between them, here Suessiones, which is the object of deterrere. The name of the Suessiones survives in the modern Soissotis.
fratres consanguineosque: the second word defines more accurately the first, which is sometimes used in the figurative sense of allies. — buos: refers to the subject of potuerint, i.e. the Remi.— eodem . . . legibus : the same constitution (legal system) and the same laws (special enactments). A. 410; B. 218. 1 ; G. 407; H. 477. I; HB. 429.
ipsis: here practically an indirect reflexive. A. 300. b; B. 249. 3; G. 521. N. 4; H. 509. 6; HB. 263. — quin consentirent:
Original from UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIANOTES
from uniting. A. 558; B. 295. 3. a; G. 555. 1; H. 595. 2; HB. 502. 3. b.
Try to put this speech into the direct form. Change the main infinitives to indicatives of the same tense; five infinitives will remain unchanged. Two verbs, potuerint and consentirent, must remain subjunctive; the others must be changed to the indicative. Be careful about pronouns. The first sentence will run as follows : Nos nostraque omnia . . . populi Romani permittimus. The last four lines will be: Tantusque est . . . furor ut . . . co?isanguineos- que nostros, qui . . . legibus utuntur . . . magistratum nobis cum habent, deterrere potuerimus quin . . . consentiant.
IV. 15. essent: A. 573, 574; B. 300. 1; G. 467; H. 649. II; HB. 534. 2. III. This question in the direct form would be, Quae civitates quant aeque in armis sunt ? — quid possent: how strong they were. A. 390. c; B. 176. 2; G. 334; H. 409. I ; HB. 387. III. — Belgas: subject of the four following infinitives. Nearly all the remainder of this chapter is in indirect discourse.
16. a Germanis: see Introd., pp. 23, 24.—Rhenum: depends on traductos. A. 395. N. 2; B. 179. 1. 3; G. 331. R. 1; H. 413; HB. 386. a.
solos : pred. adj., (the Belgae) were the only ones. — memoria: A. 423; B. 231; G. 393; H. 486; HB. 436. b. — omni Gallia vexata : trans, by a when-clause. See Introd., p. 5.
ingredi: from entering. An infinitive is very common with prohibeo. A. 558. b. N.; B. 295. 3. N.; G. 549. n. 1 ; H. 566. 2; HB. 502. 3. b, 587.— prohibuerint: A. 535. b; B. 283. 2; G. 631. 1 ; H. 591. 5 ; HB. 521. 1. a.
fieri : inf. in ind. disc.; trans, it was coming to pass. What was coming to pass ? The answer gives the subject of fieri. It is, of course, the clause that follows.—uti sibi sumerent: that they took upon themselves. A. $69. 2; B. 297. 2; G. 553. 3; H. 571. 1 ; HB. 521. 3. a. In the direct form it would be qua ex re fit uti . . . sumant. — memoria: abl. of cause; cf. mobilitate, p. 90,
22. omnia . . . explorata: that they had everything ascertained. This expression emphasizes the result of action, whereas omnia se exploravisse, that they had ascertained everything, would emphasize the action itself. A. 497. b ; B. 337. 7 (337. 6) ; G. 238 ; H. 431. 3 ; HB. 605. 5. In expressions like this we see the origin of the perfect tense in English, French, and other modern languages.
23- propinquitatibus : the Remi were Belgae.
24. quantam . . . pollicitus sit: how great a number each

(chief) had promised, ind. quest. A favorite position of quisque is page immediately after a reflexive, relative, or interrogative.	91

virtute: abl. of cause or abl. of specification. A. 418;
B. 226; G. 397; H. 480; HB. 441.
armata milia centum: a hundred armed thousands, i e. a hundred thousand armed men. So electa milia LX, sixty thousand picked men.
totius: for declension see the grammar. — sibi: for themselves. A. 376; B. 188. 1; G. 344; H. 425. 2; HB. 366.
Suessiones . . . finitimos: in the direct form, Suessiones nostri sunt finitimi; suos must refer to the speakers, the Remi. If the reference were to the Bellovaci, horum would be used.
Diviciacum: not, of course, Diviciacus the Haeduan, a prominent character in Bk. I, who is mentioned in the next chapter.
— qui . . . obtinuerit: who had held control not only of a great part of these regions but also even of Britain. The correlatives cum . . . turn are nearly equal to et . . . et.
partis: depends on imperium. A. 348; B. 200; G. 363. 2;
H. 440. 2 ; HB. 354. — regionum: A. 346; B. 201 ; G. 367 ; H.
440. 5 ; HB. 346. — obtinuerit: for tense cf. incolant, 1. 9.

B. 220. 3 ; G. 399. n. 1 ; H. 475. 3 ; HB. 414. a.
habere: sc. as subject Suessiones, or a pronoun referring to them. — numero : abl. of specification ; cf. virtute, p. 91,1. 26.
Nervios : sc. polliceri. — maxime feri: sup. of ferus. A.
128; B. 74; HB. 121. — ipsos: the Belgae. — habeantur: why is this subjunctive ?
Condrusos: with this and the following accusatives supply polliceri, or conficere posse (from p. 91,1. 27), and make the clause depend on arbitrari, 1. 8.
Germani: A. 393. a; B. 177. 3; G. 205, 206; H. 393; HB.
392. b.
appellantur: is this a part of the indirect discourse ? See note on noluerant, p. 90,1. 8. — arbitrari: sc. as subject se, referring to the Remi; direct, arbitramur, we think. Perhaps these tribes had not sent delegates to the meeting. — ad: about (up to).
The location of some of the tribes mentioned in this chapter is fixed by modern names of places, e g Bellovaci, Beauvais ; Ambiani,
Amiens.

obsides : as hostages. Perhaps the graciousness of Caesar’s speech was not fully appreciated by the Remi, when they heard the orders which followed. — ad diem: promptly, 4 on time'
rei publicae . . . intersit: it concerned the state (Rome) and the common safety (of Romans and Haedui). For rei publicae see A. 355 ; B. 210, 211. 1; G. 381; H. 449. 1; HB. 345. What is the subject of intersit t Why is intersit subjunctive ? Cf. essent',

manus hostium distineri: that the forces of the enemy be kept from uniting (be held apart). The inseparable prefix dis- means apart.—ne confligendum sit: that they might not be obliged to fight. For the impersonal use of the passive periphrastic conjugation cf. dubitandum, p. 90,1. 22. For mood of confligendum sit see A. 531. 1; B. 282. 1; G. 545. 3; H. 568; HB. 502. 2. The clause is to be closely connected with distineri.
Id : refers to matius distineri, and is subject of posse. The sentence is in indirect discourse depending on docet, 1. 13. — si Haedui introduxerint: if the Haedui led (lit. should have led). The powerful Bellovaci would thus be kept busy defending their own territory, and away from the rest of the Belgae. What mood is introduxerint ? Why ? It was future perfect in the direct form.
mandatis : here a noun.
in unum locum: in one place, but, as coactas implies motion, we have the accusative with in.
vidit: A. 543; B. 287. 1; G. 561; H. 602; HB. 554, 557.
neque: and not, connects vidit and cognovit, but the negative belongs to longe. — ab iis exploratoribus, ab Remis: connect both phrases with cognovit.
cognovit: learned. — flumen, exercitum: two accusatives with traducere, one the object of ducere, the other depending on the preposition. Cf. Rhenum traductos, p. 91, 1. 16. — extremis: how is this compared? For use of word see A. 293; B. 241. 1;
291. R. 2; H. 497. 4; HB. 244.
traducere: A. 456; B. 328. 1 ; G. 423. 2 ; H. 607; HB. 586.
ibi: north of the Aisne, near the little village of Berry-au-Bac. Thus he was between the Aisne and a small, marshy stream (the Miette). See the plan, p. 95.

7. moenibus: depends on circumiecta. A. 370; B. 187- III. 2: G. 348; H. 429. 2 ; HB. 376.
coepti sunt: this verb is usually passive when the dependent infinitive is passive. A. 205. a; B. 133. 1 ; G. 423. n. 3; H. 299. 1; HB. 199. 2.
defensoribus: abl. of separation. A. 401; B. 214. 1. b; G. 390. 1.2; H. 462; HB. 408. 3.
testudine facta: making a testudo (tortoise). See Introd., p. 46, and the illustration on p. 93.
murum: observe that not all verbs compounded with prepositions given in the rule take the dative.
Quod: this. A relative at the beginning of a sentence is usually best translated by a demonstrative or personal pronoun, often with a connective, e.g. and or but. A. 308. f; B. 251. 6; G. 610. R. 1 ; H. 510; HB. 284. 8.
conicerent: its subject is multitudo. A. 317. d; B. 254. 4. a; G. 211.R. 1. a; H. 389. 1; HB. 331. a.—consistendi: cf. con- iurandi, p. 90, 1. 5.
erat nulli: A. 373; B. 190; G. 349; H. 430; HB. 374. The subject of erat is potestas. Trans, no one was able to maintain his position. What literally ?
finem oppugnandi fecisset: had put an end to the assault (made an end of assaulting).
summa nobilitate: (a man) of the highest rank. A. 415; B. 224; G. 400; H. 473. 2; HB. 443. Caesar might have written summae nobilitatis.
oppido: A. 370; B. 187. Ill; G. 347; H. 429; HB.
376.
ex iis: this equivalent for the partitive genitive, or genitive of the whole, is especially common with numerals. See note on ex Belgis, p. 91,1. 2. —legati: as envoys. Cf. p. 91,1. 3.
nisi . . . posse: a sentence in indirect discourse, depending on nuntios mittit, which may be translated sent messengers to say that. In the direct form, nisi subsidium mihi submittetur, diutius sustinere non possum. — sibi: as submittatur implies motion, Caesar might have written ad sey but the dative makes the idea of helping more prominent than that of sending.
VII. 26. de media nocte: shortly after midnight, or about midnight. See note on de tertia vigilia, p. 61, 1. 24.—ducibus: as guides, predicate apposition to isdem.
usus : employing. A. 491 ; B. 336. 5 ; G. 282. N.; H. 640.1; HB. 601. 1.
Digitized by GOOglCsubsidio oppidanis: A. 382. 1. n. i ; B. 191. 2; G. 356;
433 ; HB. 360. b.
adventu: abl. of time and cause. — Remis accessit: was aroused in the Remi. What literally? Remis is dative depending on accessit, a compound of ad. See note on oppido, 1. 22.
propugnandi: notice the force of pro; they were eager to sally forth.
hostibus: dat., but trans, from the enemy. — potiundi: gerundive, or future passive participle, agreeing with oppidi, which limits spes. Trans, hope of taking the town, lit. hope of the town to be taken. Since the gerundive is a passive participle, it is regularly used in agreement with a noun only when the verb is transitive. See A. 503. n. 2; B. 339. 4; G. 427. n. 4. 5; H. 623. 1 ; HB. 613.2. b. n. The learner should carefully distinguish between the gerund, a verbal noun, and the gerundive. For the form potiundi (instead of potiendi) see A. p. 89, foot-note 1; B. 116. 2 ; G. 130. 8; H. 243; HB. 184. N.
oppidum, vicis, aedificiis: see note on p. 57,1. 22.
quo: an adverb, equivalent to ad quae. — incensis: this participle is parallel to the deponent participles morati and depopulati, and may be translated having set on fire.
omnibus copiis: cum might have been used. A. 413. a; B. 222. 1; G. 392. R. 1; H. 474. 2. N. 1; HB. 420.
a . . . duobus: less than two miles away. Perhaps the best explanation of this phrase is that which regards a as an adverb, and the ablative as one of degree, or measure, of difference. A. 414; B. 223; G. 403; H. 479; HB. 424. For minus see A. 407. c; B. 217. 3; G. 296. R. 4; H. 471. 4; HB. 416. d.
 milibus: not to be explained as in 1. 1, but as an ablative following the comparative. A. 406; B. 217. 1; G. 398; H. 471; HB. 416, 417.
VIII. 4. et, et: both, and.
opinionem virtutis : opinion of their valor, their reputation for valor; for the case cf. partis, p. 91,1. 32. See Introd., p. 25. — proelio : i.e. a pitched battle ; abl. of separation.
quid posset: see note on quid possent, p. 91,1. 15.
auderent: a semi-deponent verb.

A. 419. a; B. 227. 1; G. 409; H. 489; HB. 421. — pro castris : the front of a camp should be the side towards the enemy. A glance at the plan shows that here no side exactly fronted the Belgian lines, but it seems pretty cer-
Original from UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIANOTES
tain that Caesar meant by the front the part facing westward. —ad aciem instruendam : for drawing up a line of battle, a gerundive phrase depending on opportuno and idonep. A. 385. a ; B. 192. 2. n. ; G. 359. R. 3; H. 435. 1 ; HB. 384. 2.
editus: rising, lit. having been put forth. — tantum: sc. loci, and connect with patebat as acc. of extent; extended erver as much space as a battle-line, etc. This refers to the portion of the hill west of the camp. See the plan. — adversus: frotiling (the enemy), an adj. agreeing with collis.
quantum : obj. of occupare and correlative to tantum. — loci: A. 346. a. 3 ; B. 201. 2 ; G. 369; H. 442 ; HB. 346.
ex utraque parte: on both sides. Ex and ab are frequently used in expressions denoting position, contrary to the English idiom. A. 429. b; G. 390. 2. N. 6; H. 485. 4; HB. 406. 2. — lateris delectus : i.e. steep lateral slopes, whereas the front sloped gradually. — in fronte : cf. pro castris, 1. 8.
paulatim: do not confuse this word with paululum ox paulisper.— redibat: as the upward slope of a hill may be said to leave the level of the plain, so the downward slope may be said to 1 return.’
transversam: crosswise, i.e. at right angles to the axis of the hill. See the plan. —obduxit: notice the force of ob; the purpose was to oppose or obstruct an attacking party. This is the main verb of the sentence.—passuum quadringentorum: limits fossam. A. 425. a; B. 203. 2; G. 365. r. 2; H. 440. 3; HB.
ad extremas fossas: at the ends of the trenches. A. 293; B. 241. 1 ; G. 291. R. 2; H. 497. 4; HB. 244.
tormenta: see Introd., p. 50.—instruxisset: A. 593; B. 324. 1 ; G. 663. 1 ; H. 652; HB. 508, 509.
poterant: indicative because it is the writer’s statement of the reason. The use of possent would have indicated that the reason was present in Caesar’s mind at the time of digging the trenches. — ab lateribus : if the trenches had not been dug, the enemy could have reached the right of the Roman line by crossing the Miette at their own left and then following the stream, and the Roman left by passing behind the camp and along between the hill and the Aisne. See the plan.
duabus legionibus: what were their numbers? See In- trod., p. 36. Raw legions were commonly assigned to camp duty, or stationed as a reserve.
ut . . . possent: a clause of purpose. — si . . . esset: wherever (if to any place) it might be necessary. The subjunctive
Original from UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIATHE WAR WITH THE BELGAE	319
may be explained on the same principle as instruxisset, 1. 16. — subsidio : as a reinforcement, tit. for help. Why dative?
21. eductas instruxerunt: we may translate led out and drew up.
22. Palus: the Miette flowed through this marsh. — nostrum : from noster; sc. exercitum.
Hanc: see note on id, p. 92, 1. 30. — si . . . exspectabant: the enemy were waiting (to see) if our men would cross. A. 576. a; B. 300. 3; G. 460. 1. b; H. 649. II. 3; HB. 582. 2. a.
si . . . fieret: depends on adgrederentur. Cf. si .. . esset, 1. 19. — ut . . . adgrederentur : that they might attack them at a disadvantage. — impeditos: i.e. as they were struggling through the marsh.
contendebatur : impersonal ;^cf. sustentatum est, p. 93, 1. 2. — faciunt: A. 543 ; B. 287. 1. a ; G. 561 ; H. 602 ; HB. 557.
equitum proelio : equivalent to equestri proelio. — proelio: abi. abs. with secundiore. — nostris: to our men; it depends on secundiore. A. 384; B. 192. 1 ; G. 359; H. 434. 2; HB. 362. I.
ad flumen: to the west of Caesar’s camp. Apparently the Belgae did not cross the Miette.
quod : the antecedent is flumen.
31. eo consilio: with this design. — ut . . . prohiberent: this explains eo consilio. Four of the subjunctives are verbs of the ut- clause. On these the clauses si possent and si minus potuissent depend. The two relative clauses do not help to express the plan of the Belgae, but are added by Caesar, and their verbs are therefore indicative. — castellum : cf. p. 92,1. 26. This castellwn was south of the Aisne.
minus : when a protasis is repeated in a negative form, minus is often used instead of non.
magno nobis usui: of great use (or very useful) to us. See note on subsidio oppidanis, p. 93, 1. 28. The Remi were traitors to the Belgae, and were furnishing supplies to Caesar. Cf. Chap. III.
ad bellum gerendum : in (for) carrying on the war.
4. certior factus : cf. certior fiebat, p. 90, 1. 3. The nature of the ground no doubt concealed the movements of the Belgae from Caesar.
levis armaturae : of light equipment, i.e. light-armed. The expression is equivalent to an adjective. A. 345 ; B. 203; G. 365 ; H. 440. 3; HB. 355.—ponte: by way of the bridge. A. 429. a; B. 218. 9; G. 389; H. 476; HB. 426. a.—traducit: sz.flumen.
in eo loco : see the plan.
Hostis : obj. of adgressi.

8. per . . . reppulerunt: we should be likely to say over their bodies the rest attempted to cross, but were driven back. This expedient of changing the voice of a verb in translation is often a very convenient means of preserving emphasis.
primos . . . interfecerant: we may say the foremost were surrounded and killed, or, keeping the voice of interfecerunt, they surrounded and killed the foremost. Is equitatu abl. of means, or of agent ?
expugnando : is this a gerund, or a gerundive? — oppido : Bibrax; cf. Chaps. VI and VII.
se: the indirect reflexive. A. 300. 2; B. 244. 1. II. a; G. 521; H. 504; HB. 262. 2. — neque: connects intellexerunt and viderunt, both of which are introduced by ubi, as is also coepit; but the negative should be put with progredi.
pugnandi causa: one of the ways of expressing purpose. Consult the grammar. The student should accustom himself to finding things in his grammar with the help of the index. Either the word i purpose1 or the word 4 gerund1 should put him on the track of this construction. — ipsos: a more distinctive word than eos, marking a contrast with nostros.
constituerunt: the principal verb of the sentence. Depending on it we have a clause in indirect discourse representing a decision as to a fact, optimum esse standing for optimum est, and a clause with the subjunctive representing a decision as to a course of action. It is not uncommon for a verb to have object-clauses of different forms.
domum suam: to his Jiotne. A. 427. 2; B. 182. 1. b; G. 337; H. 419. 1; HB. 450. b. — reverti: subject of esse, and has qtiemque for its subject. Learn its principal parts from the Vocabulary. It is semi-deponent, having active forms in the perfect, passive in the present. How does it differ, then, from audeo? — quorum: its antecedent is eos, 1. 16. A relative clause very often precedes the clause containing the antecedent of the relative.
17. convenirent: to come together. A subjunctive depending on constituo is regularly introduced by ut. See A. 565. a. N.; B. 295. 8; G. 546; H. 565; HB. 502. 3. a. — ut . . . decertarent . . . uterentur: a clause of purpose. On what does it depend ? In studying syntax always consider this question. It is the only way to understand a sentence fully.
sententiam: decision.
ratio : consideration. It is explained by the appositive clause quod . . . cognoverant. A. 572; B. 299. 1 ; G. 525. 2; H. 588. 3;

HB. 549, 552. 1. — finibus appropinquare: were drawing near to the territory. The dative is the usual construction with this verb.
His . . . poterat: trans, freely these could not be persuaded to wait longer and not aid their people. His depends on persuaderi, which is used impersonally, as all intransitive verbs must be when passive. ‘ I am persuaded 1 is not persuadeor, but mihi persuadetur, lit. it is persuaded (made acceptable) to me. A. 372 ; B. 187. II. b; G. 208. 2 ; H. 426. 3 ; HB. 364. 2. By his is meant the Bellovaci in the Belgian army. Caesar’s scheme had worked well; cf. p. 92,11. 13-17. — ut . . . morarentur . . . ferrent : subject of persuaderi poterat.
XI. 5. secunda vigilia: abi. of time. See note on de tertia vigilia, p. 61, 1. 24.
castris : e castris might have been used. — nullo . . . imperio : in no definite order and under no definite direction. No one superintended the movement. A. 412 ; B. 221; G. 399; H. 473. 3 ; HB. 422. — cum . . . peteret: A. 549; B. 286. 2 ; G. 586; H. 598 ; HB. 526. We might translate every one trying to get for himself.
sibi: A. 376; B. 188. 1; G. 345; H. 425. 2; HB. 366. Notice its emphatic position, with quisque just after it, and see note on p. 91, 1. 24.
fecerunt ut . . . videretur: caused the departure to seem like flight. See note on possent, p. 92, 1. 25. — fugae : see note on Belgis, p. 90, 1. 19.
Caesar: the common subject of perspexerat and continuit. Trans, having learned. . . and fearing . . . because he . . . Caesar kept. — speculatores: spies, sent secretly to obtain information. — veritus : see note on usus, p. 93, 1. 27.
castris: the idea of means is present in this ablative as wrell as that of place. — confirmata . . . exploratoribus: since the fact had been corroborated by the scouts. For the exploratores see note on p. 61,1. 21.
qui . . . moraretur: see note on qui deduceret, p. 90, 1. 17.
His: dat. with the compound verb; see note on oppido, p. 93, 1. 22. Why is it plural ?
novissimos : those in the rear.
eorum fugientium: of them as they fled. Do not say i of those fleeing.’
cum: causal, introducing three verbs, consisterent, sustinerent, and poneretit. Though these verbs are grammatically coordinate, logically the first two are somewhat subordinated to the third. Notice that the first two are connected by -que, while the
Y
Digitized b, GOOgle	UNIVERSI^ OF Othird, which has a new subject, stands without a connective. It is as if Caesar had said i because, while (it is true) those at the end of the line stood their ground bravely, those farther forward were thrown into a panic and fled.’ — ab extremo agmine: see note on ex utraque parte, p. 94, 1. 12.—ventum erat: trans, personally. those to whom they (the pursuers) had come, those whom they had overtaken.
20. imperio: cf. 1. 6. — perturbatis ordinibus: broke ranks and, etc.
22. tantam multitudinem quantum fuit: lit. a number as great as was the length of the day, i.e. as great a number as there was tune for. See Introd., p. 45, for the usual treatment of a defeated army.
23- sequi: A. 456; B. 328. 1 ; G. 423. 2; H. 607; HB. 586.
24. erat imperatum : they had been ordered^}it. it had been commanded. Why is the verb used impersonally?
XII. 25. Postridie eius diei: the next day, lit. on the morrow (next day) of that day. The genitive diei requires no special explanation, but the student may consult A. 359. b; B. 201. 3. a; H. 446. 5 ; HB. 380. c. — se reciperent: could recover. A. 551. b ; B. 292. 1. b; G. 577 ; H. 605. II; HB. 507. 4. b. Caesar’s plan was to deal with the tribes of the Belgae one at a time.
magno itinere : by a forced march. — Noviodunum : this has been identified with the modern Soissons, named from the Suessiones. Probably it was near the site of Soissons, at all events.
ex itinere: see note on p. 92, 1. 30.
ab defensoribus : abl. of separation. The preposition might have been omitted.
paucis defendentibus: abl. abs., to be translated by a clause beginning with though. — expugnare : to carry by storm, whereas oppugtiare means to assault.
Castris munitis: the building of camps is constantly referred to by Caesar. See Introd., p. 41. — vineas: see Introd., p. 47. — quaeque: -que is the enclitic, and. The antecedent of quae is not expressed. — ad oppugnandum: for assaulting, for the assault.
ex fuga: belongs grammatically with convenit, but its position unites it closely with multitudo, about as if it were fugientium, agreeing with Suessionum. Those are meant who had escaped the slaughter told of in the previous chapter.
1. aggere, turribus: see Introd., pp. 47, 48. — magnitudine: goes with permoti.

4. petentibus . . . conservarentur: inasmuch as the Remi	page
begged that they should be spared. The Remi were, it will be re-	97
membered, kinsmen of the Suessiones. Cf. p. 91,1. 11.
6. primis : the leading men.
Galbae: cf. p. 91, 1. 33.
in . . . accipit: in English idiom accepted the surrender of the Suessiones. — in Bellovacos: after the battle on the Aisne Caesar marched westward, reaching first the Suessiones, then the powerful tribe of the Bellovaci. See the map facing p. 91.
Qui cum: A. 308. f; B. 251. 6; G. 610. r. 1 ; H. 510; HB.

passis: from pando. — suo more: according to their custom; A. 418. a; B. 220. 3; G. 397; H. 475. 3; HB. 414. a.
18. Haeduorum copiis: the forces with which Diviciacus had threatened the Bellovaci. Cf. p. 96, 1. 2. — facit verba: made a plea.
omni tempore . . . amicitia: i.e. they had always been faithful friends.
impulsos . . . intulisse : this sentence will not be troublesome, if one sees plainly that defecisse and intulisse belong with ijnpulsos (Bellovacos), while perferre has Haeduos for its subject, and depends on dicerent. Notice the tenses of the infinitives. The principes said Haedui perferunt, while Diviciacus said impulsi et defecerunt et intulerunt. Why is dicerent subjunctive ?
civitati intulissent: had brought upon the state.	98
profugisse : sc. eos, the implied antecedent of qui. — Petere : Bellovacos and Haeduos form its subject.
sua dementia: his custo?jiary clemency. Clementia is the mildness of one in authority; mansuetiido, gentleness of disposition.
utatur: the previous subjunctives of this passage have been imperfect or pluperfect, from here on they are present or perfect.
Such a change is common, especially in long passages of indirect discourse. The ruling verb is facit (p. 97, 1. 18), a historical present. A. 485. e; B. 268. 3; G. 654. n. ; H. 546; HB. 491. 1.2.
Quod . . . amplificaturum: in the direct discourse, quod si

page	feceris (fut. perf.), amplificabis. — auctoritatem: Caesar might be
98	expected to wish to increase the prestige of the Haedui, because
they were allies of Rome.
quorum : its antecedent is Belgas. — si . . . consuerint: direct, si inciderunt, sustentare consuevimus. Remember that Diviciacus, a Haeduan, is speaking.
consuerint: for consueverint, a perfect with present meaning. See consuesco in Vocab.
10. honoris . . . causa : i.e. to show honor to Diviciacus and the Haedui. A. 404. c; B. 198. 1; G. 373. r. 1; H. 475. 2; HB. 339. d.
eos in fidem recepturum: would take them under his protection, i.e. would accept their allegiance; cf. p. 97, 1. 13.
magna auctoritate: of great influence; abl. of quality, or description. — multitudine : abl. of specification, or respect.
dc : sescentos. This was a very large number.
Nervii: three tribes, the Suessiones, the Bellovaci, and the Ambiani, had submitted with scarcely a show of resistance. We shall read that the Nervii acted differently. — Quorum: poss. gen., limiting natura and moribus.
Nullum . . . mercatoribus: that traders had no access to them. For case of mercatoribus see A. 373; B. 190; G. 349; H. 430; HB. 374. Regarding the 7nercatores see note on p. 55,1. 8.
nihil vini: no wine, lit. nothing of wine; A. 346. a. 1; B. 201. 1 ; G. 369; H. 440. 5 ; HB. 346. — pati : sc. eos, i.e. Nervios.
rerum . . . pertinentium :	i.e.	luxuries.	— inferri :	A.
563. c; B. 331. Ill; G. 553. 2. N.; H. 614; HB. 587.
feros : how is this compared ? Cf. maxime feri, p. 92, 1. 3. — magnae virtutis: gen. of quality, or descriptive gen. Notice that it limits homines, and is equivalent to an adjective.
dedidissent: it would be subjunctive in the direct form also, since it stands in a relative clause expressing cause. A. 535. e; B. 283. 3. a; G. 633; H. 592; HB. 523. — patriam: of their fathers, ancestral.
sese : not subject of confirmare, but of missutos and accepturos (esse).
25. triduum: why accusative? — iter fecisset: had marched. Trace Caesar’s route on the map.
Sabim: for the form see A. 75. a. 1; B. 38. 1; G. 57. 1; H. 102. 2 ; HB. 88. 1. — amplius : cf. minus, p. 94, 1. 1.

B. 218. 8; G. 405; H. 477. II; HB. 425. Farther on, vidissent evidently needs a conjunction. — legiones : the seventh and twelfth. , Cf. 11. 1-6.
Numidas: they were famous archers.
desperatis nostris rebus: despairing of our success, lit. our things being despaired of In the active desperare de re is used by Gaesar rather than desperare rem. — contenderunt: its subject is equites Treveri. This sentence may well be broken up in English into several short sentences.

XXV. 25. Caesar: subject of processit, p. 104, 1. 6. We last saw Caesar in Chap. XXI. This sentence, though long, is not difficult. In finding the meaning follow strictly the order of the Latin.

legionum duarum: cf. p. 100,11. 19-21.

comparison with the huge size of their own bodies, is generally a subject of contempt to all the Gauls.
in muro: verbs of placing, unless active motion is emphasized, regularly take the ablative with in. A. 430; G. 385. r. i ; H.418. 3; HB. 433. c. Cf. the construction with coniectos, p. 105,1. 10. — sese . . . confiderent: trust that they could place. The Atuatuci were acquainted with towers placed along a line of wall, but probably not with movable towers. Hence they affected to assume that this tower must be picked up and placed on the wall — an idea which struck them as very ridiculous. Why is confiderent subjunctive?
15. moveri: that it was moving.
ad hunc modum : after this fashion, as follows.
qui . . . possent: probably subjunctive in the direct form, a causal relative clause. A. 535. e; B. 283. 3; G. 633; H. 592; HB. 523.

Unum deprecari: in the direct form unum petimus ac deprecamur. Petere means to ask; deprecari, to pray that something may not happen.
dementia: see note on sua dementia, p. 98, 1. 6.
audirent: kept hearing about.—statuisset: fut. perf. ind. in the direct form. — esse conservandos: that he ought to spare. What literally ?
ne . . . despoliaret: explains ununt, and is therefore virtually the object of petere and deprecari. — Sibi: notice the emphatic position of this word. The reflexive refers of course to the Atuatuci.
virtuti: A. 367 ; B. 187. II. a ; G. 346 ; H. 426. 2 ; HB. 362. II. — traditis armis : equivalent to si arma tradita essent.
Sibi . . . deducerentur: in the direct form nobis praestat (it is better for us), si . . . deducemur. The subject of praestare is pati.
 quamvis: any whatever, from quivis. — quam: than, after the comparative force in praestare. — ab his : the finitimi of 1. 23.
consuessent: for consuevissent. Consuesco is an inchoative (or inceptive) verb. A. 263. 1; B. 155. 1; G. 133. V, 191. 2; H. 365; HB. 212. 2. Notice that this verb has virtually a present meaning in the perfect tense, and cf. cognosco.
29. priusquam . . . attigisset: before the battering- ram touched the wall. Only so could the surrender be considered voluntary. See Introd., p. 49.
31. armis traditis: abl. abs. — in Nerviis: in the case of the Nervii.

Digitized by GOOgk	UNIVERSITY OF C32. ne . . . inferrent: not to do any injury to those who had surrendered to (lit. to the captives of) the Roman people. When is quis (qui) indefinite?
adauos: why not dative? — quae imperarentur: the things which were commanded. The clause is the object of facere.
facere: sc. se as subject. The future infinitive might have been used, but the envoys say, in effect, ‘We are already obeying your commands.’
This is a good time to review the principles of indirect discourse and the sequence of tenses. In changing a sentence from the indirect to the direct form, observe these rules: (1) Change the main infinitive to an indicative, except in the case of the conclusion of a conditional sentence which requires the subjunctive; use imperfect, perfect, or pluperfect for the perfect infinitive, as the meaning demands. (2) Put dependent clauses in the indicative, unless you know of some reason why the subjunctive should be used ; if a tense of completed action is used in the indirect form, use a similar tense in the direct form. (3) Let sense determine the choice of pronouns and the person of verbs.
sic ut . . . adaequarent: so that the piles of arms almost equaled in height (lit. equaled the greatest height of) the wall and agger. The agger had been carried forward almost to the edge of the moat. The verb aequo is derived from the adjective aequus.
circiter: is this a preposition or an adverb?
portis . . . usi: they threw open their gates and that day enjoyed peace. What compounds of facio have fio in the passive? A. 204. a. b; B. 122. Ill; G. 173. N. 2 ; H. 274; HB. 195. a.
XXXIII. 8. nequam '.that . . . no. — noctu: an adverb.
9. ante: here an adverb. — ut intellectum est: as became clear. — consilio : abl. abs. with inito.
indiligentius servaturos : woidd keep less careful watch.
partim, partim : nearly equivalent to alii, alii, some, others. — quae . . . celaverant: limits iis armis.
scutis . . . factis . . . intextis: abl. abs., yet in effect parallel with cum iis armis. Trans. with shields made of bark or woven of (by ?neans of) osiers.

tertia vigilia: see note on de tertia vigilia, p. 61, 1. 24	
qua: where.
ascensus: evidently the Roman works were on ground higher than that which lay between them and the town.

fecerunt: has the subject of this verb been expressed?
ignibus . . . est: the news being spread by fires, there was a rush to that place from the nearest redoubts. The signals in this case were probably bonfires. One kind of signal consisted of a torch displayed from a wooden or stone tower, the torch being thrust forth in the direction from which danger threatened. See the picture, p. 107.
pugnatum . . . debuit: i.e. the enemy fought as fiercely as brave men ought to have fought, etc. As the English verb i ought ’ is defective, we have to translate the present infinitive pugnari by a perfect. A. 486. a; B. 270. 2; G. 254. R. 1; H. 618. 2; HB. footnote 2 on p. 311.
eos qui iacerent: men who were throwing; a rel. clause of characteristic.
vallo turribusqufe: cf. p. 106, 1. 6. Towers were erected at intervals along the line of the vallum. — cum . . . consisteret: at a time when all hope rested in valor alone. Cum is a relative word, from the same root as the relative pronoun, and the subjunctive is subjunctive of characteristic.
ad : about, used as an adverb.
Postridie eius diei: see note on p. 96,1. 25.
iam nemo: no one any longer.
sectionem: including both goods and people. — vendidit: see its derivation in Vocab., and note the quantity of its e. The purchasers were mercatores. See Introd., p. 38. Caesar’s reputation for dementia must have suffered, but, after -all, such action as the townspeople had been guilty of could not be left unpunished. The Atuatuci were not all destroyed, for we find them three years later storming a Roman camp.
Caesar’s policy of dealing with the tribes of the Belgae one at a time had been very successful. He had met with little resistance except from the Nervii.
XXXIV. r. a P. Crasso : abl. of agent with certior factus est. This was the Crassus who had commanded the Roman cavalry in the battle with Ariovistus. See Bk. I, Chap. LII.—legione una: the seventh, as we see from Bk. Ill, Chap. VII.
3. quae: agrees in gender with civitates. A. 306; B. 250. 3;
614. R. 3. b; H. 396. 2; HB. 326. 1.
5. esse redactas : evidently these tribes were not all thoroughly subdued, for several of them were in arms the following year. Some of these names of tribes survive in modern names, e.g. Veneti, Vannes; Coriosolites, Corseult; Redones, Rennes.

XXXV. 6. pacata: having been rendered peaceful\ i.e. having been subdued. — huius belli: the war with the Belgae.
8. incolerent: subj. by attraction. — qui pollicerentur: to promise. — se: indirect reflexive, referring not to qui, but to the logical subject of the sentence; as if Caesar had written, ‘ The states across the Rhine sent ambassadors to promise that they.’
Italiam: Gallia Citerior was beginning to be called Italy. See Introd., p. 21. — inita proxima aestate : at the beginning of the following summer, abl. abs. expressing time.
in . . . hiberna: to be taken with dedtictis. From the name Carnutes comes the modern Chartres: from Andes, Anjou; from Turoni, Tours and Touraine.
quaeque civitates: and the states which.
quod : the antecedent is not, of course, supplicatio, but the sentence dierum . . . est; trans, an honor which. A supplicatio of twelvp days was decreed to Pompey after his victory over Mithridates.
BOOK III
I. 1. in Italiam: see the last chapter of Bk. II.
quod . . . volebat: a substantive clause, subject of fuit, causa being predicate nominative. — iter : subject of patefieri. The route through the Great St. Bernard pass is probably meant. The growing importance of Gaul rendered an easy communication with the country beyond the Alps necessary to Rome.—quo: by which; its antecedent is iter.
portoriis : tolls, levied on goods transported through a country.— patefieri: see note on p. 107,1. 6.
arbitraretur : although this is not formal indirect discourse, yet it does represent indirectly Caesar’s word, arbitraberis. — uti . . . conlocaret: obj. of permisit.
secundis: favorable, a common meaning of secundus.
11. ipse: agrees with the subject of constituit, but should be translated with hiemare. — reliquis cohortibus: how many were there ?

ex ea parte: to be taken with discessisse. — concesserat: why not subjunctive ?
Id: it, subject of acciderat, and explained by the clause ut . . . caperent.
quod . . . despiciebant: this clause and the clause quod . . . existimabant explain cattsis. Two more causes are given by quod . . . habebant, p. no, 11. 5-9, which is made grammatically the subject of accedebat. — legionem . . . plenissimam: a (mere) legion, and not a very full one at that.
compluribus: abl. abs. with absentibus.
commeatus petendi: A. 503; B. 339. 1; G. 427; H. 626. 1; HB. 613.
paucitatem: no doubt one reason for the smallness of the legion was that it had suffered severely in the battle with the Nervii. Cf. Bk. II, Chap. XXV.
decurrerent: this represents a future indicative, which would express the Gauls’ thought as they made their plan.
Accedebat quod : there was the additional reason that, etc.
suos liberos abstractos: sc. esse; that their children had been taken away. A. 572. b; B. 331. V; G. 533; H. 614; HB. 594.
obsidum nomine : as hostages, lit. under the name of hostages.
Romanos . . . habebant: had become convinced (lit. had it persuaded to themselves) that the Romans were trying to seize the heights of the Alps not merely for the sake of the passes, but also for the sake of a permanent occupation; and (that they were trying) to join this region to the neighboring province. A clause used as a noun is always regarded as neuter; hence persuasum, which agrees with the clause Romanos . . . conari, object of habebant, is neuter.
finitimae : the Allobroges, recently subdued, were near this place. See Introd., p. 6, and cf. p. 109,1. 3.
III. 10. opus hibernorum: the building of the winter camp. See Introd., p. 43.
munitiones: the fossa and vallum.
esset provisum: impersonal; trans, by making an abstract noun from the meaning of the verb, provision had been made.
consilio : a council of war, probably of the tribunes and the centurions of the first rank (see Introd., p. 34), with perhaps the cavalry officers.
cum: since) introducing three subjunctives.accidisset: this word is used of an unexpected event, often, as here, of a misfortune. Compare the English word ‘ accident.’ Contingere is more often used of a favorable event.
completa conspicerentur: were seen (to be) covered.— neque subsidio veniri: sc. posset, lit. and it could not be come (by any one to them) for aid; freely, and no aid could come to them.
desperata salute : this passive construction implies an active desferare salutem, a construction which is found in some authors. Caesar, however, says desperare de, or uses the dative. — eius modi: of the following sort, explained by the substantive clause ut . . . contenderent.
21. Maiori . . . placuit: the majority, however,thought it best. What is the subject of placuit ?
25. conlocandis, administrandis: in agreement with iis rebus. Trans.for arranging and executing those things. We have here the gerundive construction in the dative. A. 505. N.; B. 339. 2;
429. 1; H. 627; HB. 613. 1.
decurrere: historical inf. — gaesa: heavy javelins. They seem to have been used especially by Alpine tribes; Vergil speaks of Alpina gaesa. See Vocab.
propugnare: observe the force of pro.
ex loco superiore: i.e. from the rampart of the camp.
defensoribus : abl. of separation, with nudata.
eo: i.e. ad earn partem castrorum. — hoc superari, quod: they were at a disadvantage in this, that; hoc is abl. of cause; or perhaps abl. of specification, or respect. The subject of this historical infinitive, as of the four preceding, is nostri.

quarum . . . poterat: while nothing of this sort could be done by our men, by reason of their small numbers.
non modo . . . sed ne . . . quidem: A. 217. e; B. 343. 2. a; G. 482. R. 1; H. 656. 3 ; HB. 299. The ne really belongs with dabatur, and hence its force supplies the extra negative which English idiom requires. Trans, not only was opportunity not given to one who was tired, but not even to a wounded man, etc.
constiterat: had taken his stands nearly equivalent to stabat, was standing. — relinquendi : gerundive agreeing with loci.
sui recipiendi: withdrawing, lit. taking himself back. A. 504. c; B. 339. 5 ; G. 428. r. 1; H. 626. 3 ; HB. 614.
3. Cum pugnaretur: when the fight had been going on. This use of the imperfect is more common in the indicative. See A.

12. Germania: the hordes of Ariovistus. See the latter half of Bk. I and Introd., p. 12.
in Illyricum: cf. Bk. II, Chap. XXXV. Caesar appears to have started before Galba’s difficulties began.

quo in numero : among whom. — eat missus : to be taken together.
Esuvios, Coriosolites: look up these tribes on the map of Gaul.

23. omnis orae maritimae: i.e. of all the maritime states.
 quod et, et: because, in the first place, and also. The force of quod extends through antecedunt.
quibus : abl. of means, but trans, in which. — in Britanniam: it is said that the Veneti already knew or suspected Caesar’s purpose (carried out the next year) to visit Britain, and that they wished to prevent him from interfering with their trade with that island.— consuerunt: are accustomed.

Gauls, and the ease with which they were influenced to form new plans; e.g. Bk. II, Chap. I, Bk. IV, Chap. V.
acturos: sc. se and esse. The indirect discourse depends on coniurant.
reliquasque: -que here connects two verbs. What are they ?

in se admisissent: had taken upon themselves, i.e. had committed.
legatos retentos . . . coniectos: sc. esse. The clause explains facinus, but takes the form of indirect discourse, as if dependent on intellegebant. — quod nomen: a name which. Subordinate military officers sent to procure grain could hardly be properly called legati, ambassadors; but Caesar wishes to put the act of the Gauls in the worst possible light, to justify his own subsequent action.
hoc maiore spei with the greater hope (hope greater by this).
quod . . . confidebant: explains hoc. — natura: fido and confido generally take the ablative of things and the dative of persons. Find the rules in the grammar. '

mandat: the three subjunctives depending on this verb may be explained in the same way as those on p. 111,11. 13-15.
Belgas: the Belgae had been subdued only the year before, and were still uneasy. No doubt the Veneti and other Aremo- rican states expected help from them.—adeat: some compounds of eo may be used transitively.

Caesar constructed dykes across the shoals, along which the troops marched to attack the town. Before they could deliver the assault, however, the garrison took to their ships, and sailed away to the nearest fort.” (Holmes, “Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul.”) Another theory is that Caesar built two parallel walls, or dikes, between which the soldiers marched. — moenibus: dat., depending on adaequatis.

2. Adiatunnus cum sescentis devotis: it will be necessary to look forward a long way to find anything with which to connect these words; so far, in fact, that they are repeated in cum his Adiatunnus, 1. 9. What comes between is a long parenthesis describing the devoti. In idiomatic original English this description would probably come after the narrative part of the chapter. The narrative might run, perhaps, somewhat as follows: ‘ While the attention of all our men was fixed on this proceeding, Adiatunnus, who held supreme command, with six hundred devoted followers, whom they call soldurii, tried to make a sally from another part of the town. A shout was raised from that part of the fortifications. The soldiers ran to arms, and after a fierce contest Adiatunnus was driven back,’ etc. Let the student complete the translation in this way, making two or three sentences of the description of the soldurii.
condicio : position. — ut: introduces three verbs gruantur, ferant, consciscant. The clauses are substantive clauses explaining condicio. — in vita: the position of this phrase, between omnibus and commodis, gives it almost the force of an adjective. — commodis : why ablative ?

16. paucis diebus quibus: within the few days with- in which. In force quibus nearly equals postquam, and may be translated after. A. 423 ; B. 231; G. 393 ; H. 488. 3 ; HB. 550. c.

obsessis viis, commeatu intercluso: ablatives absolute, expressing means.
impeditos: sc. eos, i.e. Romanos,
animo: in spirit, with infirmiores, — adoriri: though not strictly in indirect discourse, this verb expresses indirectly the thought of the enemy, and hence throws the dependent verb coepissent into the subjunctive.

13. exspectari . . . iretur: that they ought not to delay longer about going against the camp. The three verbs, exspectari, oportere, and iretur, are all impersonal. What is the subject of exspectari?

videri: sc. possent, from posset of the next line. The indicative here would simply state a fact. The subjunctive hints at the desire or purpose of the Romans to escape notice. Always try to see the meaning of a mood or a case. That is more important than a mere classification.
quod: a thing which, or as. The antecedent of quod is the idea contained in the words redintegratis viribus.
consuevit: is wont.
apertissimis campis: abl. of the way, or route, but with an implication of cause. Because the country was open, the cavalry could easily hunt down the fugitives. — ex numero: connect this with quarta parte.

22. confluentem Mosae et Rheni : if this reading is right, the point meant is probably the junction of the Meuse and Waal. Cf. Chap. X. But there are rather strong reasons for thinking that this massacre of the Germans actually took place farther up the Rhine, in the neighborhood of Coblenz. If so, Mosae must be a mistake for Mosellae.

page	26. ex: after.
27. ocooxxx milium: probably an excessive estimate.
libertatem: permission to do so.
The sacrifice of life in this campaign was enormous; the Germans were thoroughly cowed, and gave no further trouble. These two tribes were not annihilated, as we see from the next chapter. Besides the cavalry who escaped, there were also, no doubt, some survivors from the battle.
XVI.	2.	suis	quoque	rebus	: for their own possessions, too.
cum intellegerent: when they should learn. The use of the subjunctive is due to the fact that the clause represents Caesar’s thought, i They will fear when (if) they shall learn.’
4. Accessit quod: there was the additional reason that.
9. eos . . . dederent: that they should give up to him those who, etc.
si se invito existimaret: direct, si te invito existimas.
cur . . . postularet: why should he ask that anything across the Rhine be subject to his authority or power. The verb postularet is in the subjunctive because this is a question in indirect discourse.— suiimperi: pred. gen. of possession.
15. legatos miserant: cf. p. 127,1. 27.
Id: does this refer to exercitum ?
ad: among; the reputation had spread to the remotest tribes.

dimensa: passive in meaning, though from a deponent. Cf. dimenso, p. 100, I. 27.

1. cum: whenever, or after. See note on cum, etc., p. 116,1. 15.
machinationibus: the 7>iachinatio probably consisted of a pair of rafts fastened together, with an open space between. Over this open space and supported by both rafts would be erected a scaffolding with tackle for holding and letting down the logs, and ma-

chinery for driving them home. — immissa defixerat: had let down and set.

duo : sc. tigna, obj. of statuebat.
intervallo: connect this with statuebat. — quadragenum: A. 49. d; B. 63. 2 (25. 6) ; G. 97. R. 1; H. 169; HB. 71. 4. All things considered, it is most reasonable to believe that the forty feet were measured at the surface of the water. If so, the distance at the top, fixing the width of the bridge, would be less than this. — ab inferiore parte: sc. fluminis, down-stream.
Haec utraque : these two pairs.
trabibus immissis: abi. abs. — quantum . . . distabat:
explains immissis, i.e. the beams were let in from above as far as the cross-tie (Junctura) was distant from the top of the pier made of the two logs. Some, perhaps rightly, connect the clause with bipedalibus and explain it to mean equal to the distance between the logs, lit. as much as the joining of those logs stood apart.
binis . . . distinebantur: were held apart (kept from falling towards each other) at the top by a pair of fasteners on either side. It is entirely uncertain what the fibtdae were. The form shown in the picture would be effective, and this form seems to fit Caesar’s description as well as any that has been proposed. Crosspieces are placed in the acute angles formed by the pier and the two- foot beam on the up-stream side of the bridge, and these are fastened together by strong ropes or bands of iron. Others, similarly fastened together, are placed in the obtuse angles formed by the pier and the beam on the down-stream side of the bridge. A little reflection will show that the force of the current of the river, causing the up-stream pier to bend farther away from the perpendicular and the down-stream pier to become more nearly vertical, will tend to carry these cross-pieces farther apart and stretch and tighten the rope or metal fastenings. Cf. 11. 10-12.
quibus . . . revinctis : and as these (the opposite pairs of logs) were thus kept apart and further?nore made fast in the opposite direction, i.e. so that they would not pull apart.
ea: such.
quo . . . hoc: the . . . the.
Haec : the trestles, each consisting of two piers with the con-
Digitized by Google364	NOTES	IV
necting beam. The width of the river was probably about one fourth of a mile. If we assume that the trestles were twenty-five feet apart, fifty to sixty would be needed. The building of the successive trestles is indicated by the imperfects of the description. — derecta . . . contexebantur: were connected (woven together) by joists laid on straight, i.e. lengthwise of the bridge.
cratibus: these took the place of flooring. — nihilo setius:
e. though the work was so strong, yet.
oblique agebantur: these words seem to mean that the sublicae were driven in so as to lean not directly against the current of the river, but diagonally athwart the current.—pro ariete sublectae: placed underneath as a prop, but where and how they were placed can only be conjectured. Certainly an effective arrangement would have been that shown in the picture. Sublicae placed this way would not only brace the bridge against lateral swaying caused by the current, but also counteract longitudinal movement of the bridge.
16. aliae supra pontem: these sublicae were probably vertical. There may have been a continuous line of them across the river, or, more likely, two or three in front of each trestle, perhaps as in the picture.
18. nqu: regularly used for et ne.
This bridge was probably built near Neuwied, eight miles north of Coblenz, which is at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle. Napoleon placed it at Bonn, and various other places have been fixed upon by others. In the dredging of the river near Neuwied remains of piles have been found, which are thought to have belonged to this bridge. Somewhat less than a mile up-stream other piles have been found, arid excavations near the river reveal the remains of fortifications. These are thought to belong to the bridge and fortifications built by Caesar at the time of his second crossing of the river, two years after the first crossing. See Bk. VI, Chaps. IX and XXIX.
XVni. 1. quibus: after, lit. within which; see note on p. 120, 1. 16. — materia: do not translate this ‘material.’ — coepta erat: notice that this verb is regularly passive when the infinitive depending on it is passive.
praesidio : see note on p. 126,1.6. A castellum was no doubt built at each end of the bridge.
quo: when.
ex . . . Usipetibus: the cavalry and the survivors from the battle described in Chaps. XIV and XV.

14. tempestatem : weather, which may be either good or bad. — tertia fere vigilia : this means * about midnight.’ Explain why.— solvit: set sail; sc. navis. The point of departure was probably Portus Itius, identified by some with Boulogne, by others with Wissant. The ulterior portus would then be Amble- teuse (somewhat less than eight miles from Boulogne) or Sangatte (nearly eight miles from Wissant).

page mination of the chronology of the expedition to Britain. We know 140 (cf. Chap. XXXVI) that the full moon here mentioned was the one next preceding the autumnal equinox. The calculations of astronomers show that this full moon occurred August 31, about 3 a.m. Hence this storm occurred August 30. As this was four days (three by our method of counting) after Caesar’s arrival in Britain, the date of his arrival would be August 27. To get this date we must assume the absolute accuracy of Caesar’s statements. But, as a matter of fact, the highest tides in these regions occur a day and a half after full moon. Here is a discrepancy, and all that can be said is that Caesar’s arrival must have taken place within a day or two of August 27. — dies: used in the astronomical sense, to include also the night.
in Oceano: the Romans were most at home in the Mediterranean, where there are practically no tides. They must, however, have had experience with high tides in the war with the Veneti. Cf. p. 115,1. 10.
in aridum subduxerat: ships were beached out of the reach of ordinary waves and tides. — complebat: notice the tense.

multo gravius exarsit: one can hardly blame him.
19. Meldis: there was a tribe of Meldi living inland near the Marne and Seine. Some think that there was a maritime tribe of this name, or that the Meldi here meant were a subdivision of the Morini.
perpaucos: what is the force of per- ?
obsidum loco : as hostages.
cum abesset: while he was (should be) away.
28. Dumnorix: we have met with him before, in Bk. I, Chaps. IX, XVIII-XX.
eum: this word has four predicates, cupidum, cupidum, magni animi, magnae auctoritatis. — magni animi: of a proud spirit.
regnum deferri: a statement possibly true, though probably not. The Haedui were governed by an elective magistrate. Cf. p. 65» 1» 4*
neque: but yet . . . not.
insuetus navigandi: unaccustomed to sailing.
religionibus: by religious duties.— diceret: sometimes in the statement of a quoted reason the verb of saying or thinking is put in the subjunctive by a kind of attraction. Cf. existimarent, p. 68,1. 29.
territare: historical inf.
fieri: inf. in ind. disc., depending on the idea of saying in metu territare. Its subject is ut . . . spoliaretur.
quos: its antecedent is hos.
traductos necaret: i.e. take across and murder. — fidem . . . poscere : pledged his faith to the rest and demanded an oath from them. In other words, Dumnorix began to form a ‘conspiracy.1
ex usu Galliae : to the advantage of Gaul.
18. quod . . . tribuebat: Caesar treated the Haedui with so much honor that it would not do to have them set a bad example to the other states of Gaul.
19. coercendum atque deterrendum : Caesar did not wish to
GooglerAc.E adopt extreme measures, because harshness might alienate the friends
of Dumnorix.
quod: (<and) because.
prospiciendum . . . posset: he must look out that he (Dumnorix) should not have the power to do any harm to him and the (Roman) state.
Corus ventus : a wind blowing approximately from the northwest.
impeditis: the hampering effect of the work on their minds prevented them from noticing other things.
retrahi: see note on imperat fieri, p. 145, 1. 11. — neque pareat: and refuse to obey.
nihil pro sano : nothing as a man of rational mind, i.e. nothing rational.
praesentis: not se praesente (cf. se absente above), because it limits imperium.
3* interficiunt: so Caesar had no more trouble from Dumnorix. He was guilty of no crime, so far as Caesar tells us, but that of being a patriotic Haeduan, anxious to save his country from a foreign yoke. That was crime enough, and his death served as a warning to others.
VIII. 8. consilium . . . caperet: i.e. meet any emergency which might arise.
9. pari quern: equal (to that) which.
navis solvit: with wind from the southwest and tidal current running in the opposite direction, the fleet sailed northwesterly. When the wind died away, the current, which had turned, bore the fleet towards the northeast. In early morning the current changed again, and fdllowing the change the Romans moved back to their landing-place of the previous year. This is the view usually held. There are, however, reasons for thinking that the landing was somewhat further north than in the previous year, somewhere between Deal and Sandwich.
Africo: why should the south west wind be Africus to a Roman ?
sub sinistra relictam: he had been carried too far northeast, and was drifting away from land.
qua: where.
virtus: pluck.—vectoriis . . . adaequarunt: in their heavy transport-ships, not ceasing the labor of rowing, kept up with, etc.

legionis septimae: so the seventh legion got revenge for hard usage of the previous year. See Bk. IV, Chap.
9. testudine: see Introd., p. 46. — aggere . . . adiecto: carrying an agger up to the fortifications. This must have been a very rough-and-ready piece of work.

13. castrorum: plainly not the same as the camp mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, for that must have been on the seashore (cf. navis cum castris coniungi, 1. 31), while this was a considerable distance inland.
X. 15. expeditionem: notice derivation and meaning.

magno negotio : though with great difficulty. — fabros : in early times there were in the Roman army centuries of artisans {fabri). Caesar seems to have had no regularly organized body of workmen distinct from the legionary soldiers.
ut ... instituat: scribit is here equivalent to a verb of ordering.
legionibus : abl. of means. How many legions had Labienus ?
cum castris: this camp was no doubt partially fortified on
the afternoon of the army’s landing. Whatever further work was needed was probably done the next day by the ten cohorts left as a
praesidium.
ne . . . intermissis: not even the night-time being lost for (allowed to cause interruption to) the soldiers' work.
Subductis navibus : if the ships were arranged in a double, or even in a triple row, the frontage on the beach must have been from one to two miles.
Cassivellauno: Caswallon, ufirst of the roll of English heroes.”
milia passuum lxxx : this probably gives the distance from Caesar’s landing-place to the point where he himself crossed the Thames into the territory of Caswallon. Too much stress should not be laid on distances given by Caesar, as they can be only rough estimates.
10. continentia: i.e. without any interval between them.
Chapters XIJ-XIV contain an interesting description of Britain, in which, however, there are some statements demonstrably false, and others which we have no means of verifying.
quos . . . dicunt: who they say it has been handed down by tradition were borti (i.e. originated) in the island itself; quos is subject of natos (esse), and this clause forms the subject of proditum (esse). We may translate more freely, whom they say tradition declares to have originated in the island itself

20. Nascitur: is found.—plumbum album: tin. Long before Caesar’s time the Phoenicians went to Britain for tin; but Cornwall, the chief place of supply, is not ‘ mediterranean.’
aere importato: notice the position of each word; the copper that they use is imported.
fagum, abietem: the beech and fir are both said to be indigenous to Britain.
fas non putant: they count it a sin. — haec:	Why neuter?
animi voluptatisque causa: i.e. as pets. — Loca: the Latin has no word for * climate.’
remissioribus frigoribus: the seasons of cold (the frosts') being less severe. There are no great extremes of heat and cold in Britain, owing to the warm seas that surround it and the winds from the Atlantic.
27. natura: the word seems superfluous, but may be translated in shape. — unum latus: Caesar regards this side as extending from northeast to southwest.
inferior: sc. angulus, now Land’s End. — tenet: embraces, or extends.
Alterum: sc. latus, the second side. — ad Hispaniam: Spain is considered as being west of Britain, with Ireland lying between. Tacitus in the “Agricola” repeats this error.

Mona: the Isle of Man. — minores insulae : the islands west of Scotland.
non nulli: the scriptores were probably Greeks, who may have heard strange stories from voyagers to far-off northern lands.
5. certis . . . mensuris: by means of accurate measurements with the clepsydra. The clepsydra, or water-clock, measured time by the emptying of a vessel through a small orifice. Caesar must have found the summer nights in Britain more than an hour shorter than at Rome.
14. vicies . . . passuum: straight lines connecting Caesar’s c angles ’ would measure somewhat less than this distance; but if indentations be followed, the coast-line of Britain is more than 2000 miles.
16. humanissimi: most civilized. Shakspere mentions
Digitized by Googlethis statement of Caesar’s in the Second Part of “ King Heniy VI,” Act 4, Scene 7.
21. lacte et carne vivunt: cf. Bk. IV, Chap. I, where Caesar is speaking of the Suebi. These people had not passed from the pastoral into the agricultural stage of civilization.

25. Uxores communis: this statement could have been true only of the more remote Britons, if it was not altogether a mistake.
quo: to whom, or to whose home.
deducta est: was led (as a bride), a regular meaning of this verb.
29. Equites hostium: the story is resumed from Chap. XI.

this sentence may be found in A. 420. 5. N.
duabusque : -que connects pugnaverunt and perruperunt.
primis: the first cohort of a legion contained the best soldiers of the legion.
loci spatio: loci defines spatio, which often, as a few lines above, means time. The two cohorts probably attempted to get in the rear of the assailants, thus cutting off their retreat; but as they did not come sufficiently close together, the enemy slipped away through the interval. — novo genere pugnae: cf. Bk. IV, Chap. XXXIII.
9. submissis : notice the force of sub, i.e. as a support, or help. Cf. subsidio above.
12. nostros: sc. milites, foot-soldiers, contrasted with equites in. 1. 15.
illi: the enemy. — consulto cederent: gave way intentionally.

praecipitis : pell-mell, a pred. adj.
summis copiis : with their full force.
xvm. 4. uno omnino loco: of course not literally true* This was the only ford which Caesar found. Its location is unknown, but it was some distance above London, perhaps near Kingston or Brentford.
hoc: sc. loco.
praefixis: driven in front (of the bank). — defixae : driven down.
11. eo impetu: with such a rush. The stakes must have been removed in some way, but we are not told how. — cum: though. — capite solo: in modern times a river more than three feet deep is generally considered unfordable by an army.
13. dimitterent: abandoned.
16. milibus. . .essedariorum: from these words some infer that Caswallon had 4000 war-chariots, others that the number was 2000, since each chariot carried two men, a driver and a fighter.
19. atque: connects the verb preceding it with compellebat.
hoc metu: i.e. huius rei metu. Notice the idiom carefully.
Relinquebatur ut: the final result was that.
discedi : impersonal, sc. ab equitibus.
tantum hostibus noceretur: (only) so much damage was inflicted on the enemy; but noceretur is impersonal, and tantum is
acc.	, not nom.
quantum : obj. of efficere.
29. Trinovantes : in Essex.
adulescens: this word is regularly used to distinguish a younger from an older person of the same name, somewhat like our ‘Junior.’ Probably some older relative was named Mandubracius.
Caesaris fidem secutus : seeking Caesar's protection.
sese : obj. of dedituros.
Cassivellauni: subjective gen. — mittat, qui praesit: send him, to govern. Caswallon had met with reverses, and now his old
Original from UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIAenemies wished to revenge themselves upon him, even to the extent of handing Britain over to the Rpmans. Cf. p. 151,11. 9-11. Caesar was very ready to accept the assistance of the Trinovantes, as he had that of the Haedui in Gaul.
5. exercitui: for the army.
8. militum: at the hands of the soldiers, subjective gen.
Bibroci: some think that this name is preserved in the modern name Berkshire.
11. oppidum Cassivellauni: according to some authorities, located in the vicinity of St. Albans.
Oppidum vocant: call it a town; oppidum is a pred. acc. The Gauls, on the other hand, had real towns. Observe here the perfect indicative in the cum-clause with a present indicative in the main clause, generalizing the statement.
25. castra navalia: cf. Chap. XI.—adoriantur: this word is often used of a secret or unexpected attack.
30. civitatum : those mentioned in the preceding chapter, who followed the lead of the Trino vantes.
id . . . posse: this (the little remaining) could easily be frittered away. The death of Julia, Caesar’s daughter, wife of Pompey, had just occurred, and even before this bond was broken Pompey had begun to be jealous of Caesar. Caesar had reason to fear the effect upon his political fortunes of a prolonged absence in distant Britain.
quid vectigalis: what (<of) tribute. No measures were taken to collect this tribute, which was probably never paid.
penderet: should pay. —interdicit atque imperat: notice the fullness of expression. We may translate, with ne noceat ^strictly forbids to injure, or orders positively not to injure.
3. Obsidibus acceptis : besides hostages Caesar carried back slaves, and perhaps other booty. Dion Cassius says that Caesar himself remarked on the desolation he left behind him in Britain.
deperierant: had been utterly destroyed.
commeatibus : trips (goings forward and back).
9. inanes : two classes of vessels were sent to Caesar inanes: first, those from which the soldiers carried on the first trip had been landed; second, those which Labienus had had built. Of the latter the verb 7nitterentur would properly be used.
angustius milites conlocavit: he crowded the soldiers into rather narrow quarters.
secunda . . . vigilia: i.e. though he had not sailed until

after the beginning of the second watch.— terram attigit: the time of his return was probably about the middle of September. Caesar had very likely intended, if circumstances permitted, to winter in Britain.
Not for nearly a hundred years did a Roman force again land in Britain, and the actual conquest of the island was not completed until many years later.
18. Samarobrivae: the name means So?nme-bridge. It is generally identified with Amiens.
19. siccitates: in the previous year also Gaul had suffered from droughts. Cf. p. 143,1. 28.
23. Q. Ciceroni: brother of the orator. He was Caesar’s legatus several years. Some of his letters written from Gaul and Britain are mentioned in the extant collection of Cicero’s correspondence.
M. Crassum: an older brother of the P. Crassus mentioned in Bk. I, Chap. LII.
Unam legionem: this legion was perhaps enrolled in the spring of this year, and was probably numbered XV. Caesar therefore should have had nine legions. Only eight and one half are here accounted for. One explanation is that the five cohorts mentioned in 1. 28 belonged to XIV, and that the other five cohorts of XIV were used to fill gaps in other legions.
in Eburones: to Atuatuca, identified by Napoleon with the modern Tongres. Many scholars do not accept the identification. Some place it east of the Meuse. Caesar’s purpose undoubtedly was to command the road from northern Gaul to the Rhine.
Into the discussion of the exact location of most of the winter camps mentioned in this chapter it is unnecessary to go. Of those who have studied the question most carefully, hardly any two agree exactly.
4. mederi : meet, lit. remedy.
6. milibus passuum o continebantur: this probably means that the distance between any two camps was not more than 100 miles, but the number is certainly too small; for Samarobriva, where it appears Trebonius was located, and Atuatuca must have been more than 100 miles apart.
8. cognovisset: see note on p. 128,1. 31.
10. Carnutibus:	on	the Loire, round Orleans and
Chartres. —loco: abl. of source, or origin.
fuerat usus: for erat usus, emphasizing the fact that this action preceded that of restituerat.

22. quibus: after.
praesto fuissent: had met.
Indutiomari: see Chaps. Ill and IV.
29. Hispanis equitibus: of what nation were the most of Caesar’s cavalry ?
aliqui: aliqui is usually an adjective, and the pronominal form is aliquis.
5. eques Romanus: a Roman knight.
8. Sese: it should be easy now for the student to turn indirect discourse into direct, and it is recommended that the translation also be given in the direct form. Pro Caesaris in me beneficiis plurimum ei confiteor (nte) debere, I admit that I owe much to Caesar for his kindnesses to me.
ei: we might have had the reflexive, but a Caesare saves ei from ambiguity. Is ei equivalent in meaning to ad eum ?
14. sua imperia: his own powers.
porro \ in the next place. Having presented his own apology, Ambiorix proceeds to offer one for the state.
18. imperitus rerum: cf. p. 83,1. 28.
20. hibernis oppugnandis : for assaulting the winter ca?nps.

Such towers were often built with more than one story, and corresponding stories of adjacent towers were sometimes connected by galleries. — admodum: fully.
opus: predicate, necessary, lit. a necessity. — praeustae sudes: stakes sharpened at the end and hardened in the fire would make a very good substitute for javelins.

Gaul is given on p. 200,11. 18-20. In this case the news must have traveled nearly seven Roman miles an hour.
26. Indutiomarus: see Chaps. Ill and IV.
tribus legionibus : the three originally assigned to Crassus, Trebonius, and Cicero. — trinis : why is not tribus used?
perlato : having been reported far and wide.
reliqui: nom.pl.

12. Aremoricae: see note on p. 112,1. 22.
LIV. 17. territando: an enemy of Caesar might say by bullying,— denuntiaret: denuntio often conveys a covert threat.
Senones: mentioned in Bk. II, Chap. II. The verbs belonging to this noun are a long distance off, but the student should follow the Latin order in determining the meaning of the sentence.
dicto: dat. with audientes, obedient. They perhaps had heard of Caesar’s treatment of the Germans the year before. See Bk. IV, Chap. XIII, end.—tantum valuit: i.e. it made so great an impression. The subject of valuit is the clause esse . . . infer- endi.
Haeduos et Remos: the Haedui joined the great uprising of Gaul two years later, but the Remi remained faithful even then.
nulla non : the two negatives make an emphatic affirmative. We may reproduce the effect by translating there was almost no state that was not suspected.
nobis: A. 375; B. 189. 2; G. 354; H. 431. 2; HB. 373. 2. — Idque . . . sit: and I do not know whether that is so very much to be wondered at.
compluribus aliis de causis: large amounts of grain and immense sums of money had to be furnished by them to the Romans’; whole districts were laid waste ; their cities and homes were pillaged and burned; but no doubt, as Caesar thought, the loss of national honor was the greatest blow of all.
praeferebantur: used to be considered superior.—tantum . . . deperdidisse ut perferrent: that they had lost so much of that prestige as to {be obliged to) endure. For se deperdidisse see A. 572. b; B. 331. V; G. 533; H. 614; HB. 594.
LV. 8. multo minorem superesse: no doubt an inaccurate estimate, though Caesar had suffered fearful losses in this year’s fighting.
Ariovisti bello: see Bk. I, Chaps. XXX-LIV.
Tencterorum transitu: see Bk. IV, Chaps. I-XV.
copias cogere: see p. 147, 11. 7, 8. Probably the hostages had been given back by Caesar; otherwise Indutiomarus would hardly have dared to make open war.
tota Gallia: the locative ablative usually omits in when totus is used.
LVI. 18. ultro ad se veniri: i.e. that the Gauls were rallying round him.

clientelae: dependencies, i.e. subject tribes.
antecesserant: sc. Sequani
occupatam possiderent: seized and held.

9. Vulcanum: fire, or the fire-god.
ne . . . acceperunt: they have never even heard of. A later writer, Tacitus, makes the religion of the Germans more elaborate than Caesar represents it.

Volcae Tectosages: a Gallic tribe of this name dwelt near the Pyrenees. Doubts have been cast on Caesar’s statement that the Volcae Tectosages in Germany came from Gaul.
