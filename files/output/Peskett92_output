"NOT FOUND"|"Caesar] we read (56 end) that Caesar, after crossing the Loire on his march northward from Gergovia, proceeded to the country of the Senones. In 62 (end) it is stated that Labienus joined Caesar three days (?) after quitting Agedincum (Sens), whither he had come from Paris. The junction of the two forces is supposed by G. to have taken place at Troyes on the Seine, by Nap. at Joigny on the Yonne. Caesar now wished to march into the domain of the Sequani in order to be nearer the province; his line of march then lay according to G. from Troyes to Besantjon (Vesontio), according to Nap. from Joigny to Besanijron. Both authorities agree that he probably intended crossing the Saone in the neighbourhood of Gray in the department of Haute Saone. The Aedui at this time were hostile, and that is the reason why Caesar was obliged to march per extremos Lingonum fines, that is, along the southern border of the Lingones. The Sequani were situated between the Saone, the Rhone and M. Jura; the first-named river separated them from the Lingones."

The Romans constructed their agger stage by stage. They first laid a layer of material of about 6 ft. or so in height and of varying breadth (cf. n. on 24 latum) at right angles to the wall of the besieged town ; in the middle of this and running its entire length they left an open passage (cuniculus): this was then roofed over and on the first layer was laid a second layer or stage of material with a similar cuniculus over the first cuniculus, and so on, till the requisite number of stages, each with its own cuniculus, had raised the agger to its intended height. The cuniculi were used as gangways to protect the soldiers bringing up material for the agger, but they served their main purpose when the end of the agger nearest the town had been brought up as close to the wall as possible; for the besieged by means of firebrands, stones and other missiles could always prevent its being brought into actual contact with their wall: till this ravine-like space between the agger and the wall was filled up the town could not be stormed, and this was now effected by bringing up material through the several cuniculi and shooting it into the aforesaid place. This being filled up the Romans could wheel their moveable turres up the agger and use them against the walls. The cuniculi could also be used for undermining the enemies*** walls. In the present passage we are told that the Gauls threw stones, wood, pitch, etc., against the open ends of the cuniculi (apertos cuniculos) to prevent their being advanced nearer.***The above description is condensed from the elaborate account of the construction of the agger given by Rustow."

The Gallic cavalry had left their camp on the E. side of M. Auxois, and had engaged in a skirmish with the Roman cavalry in the plain of Les Laumes. Caesar, seeing his men hard pressed, had summoned the German cavalry to their aid, and thus reinforced the Romans had driven back the Gauls to their camp; but the gates in their stone wall were so narrow, that when the Gauls pursued by the Romans tried to re-enter their fortifications, they became completely blocked in the narrow entrances, and wrere cut down in great numbers."

Nap. 11. 241 note says that a somewhat similar system prevailed in Auvergne in the middle ages ; a chain of towers, about 400 or 500 yards apart, was built; on these watchmen were stationed who transmitted the news by sonorous monosyllables or, in case of adverse winds, by beacon fires.

"NOT FOUND"|"23 The walls seem to have been constructed thus. A row of balks of timber was laid on the ground at right angles to the line of the intended wall, an interval of two feet separating one balk from another ; then between the two ends of two adjacent balks, on what would be the outside of the wall, was placed a large stone; the rest of the interval between the two balks was filled up with earth and rubble. When every interval between the successive balks had been thus filled up, the lowest layer of the wall had been completed ; it would probably be about a foot high. On this layer was laid a second layer of balks with intervals similarly filled up with rubble inside and large stones towards the outside; only the balks of the second layer were not laid on the balks of the first, but on the intervals between them ; then a third layer was added with its balks over the intervals of the second layer and consequently above the balks of the low est layer ; and so on till the wall had reached the required height. Seen from the outside the wall would give somewhat the appearance of a chess-board, the dark squares representing the ends of the balks and the alternating light squares theOriginal from***UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIAlarge stones placed between them. This of course supposes the end of each beam to be of about the same size as the stone filling up the two- foot interval, i. e. to be itself two feet broad; but this is rather doubtful (cf. Mr Long***s note). In this description, for the sake of convenience, one particular has been omitted. When the first layer had been constructed, a long beam of about 40 ft. in length (cf. n. on pedes quadra- genos) was laid across it at right angles to the balks and therefore parallel to the line of the wall: this beam was probably mortised into the balks of the layer below' and above it, its lowrer half being buried in the balks and nibble of the first layer and its upper half in those of the layer above it: it served to clamp the balks and rubble together; this was done between the several layers and so the whole wall was considerably strengthened and prevented from being pulled apart {distrahi)."

"prima luce, cum summus mons a [lucio] labieno teneretur, ipse ab hostium castris NON LONGIUS mille et quingentis passibus abesset neque, ut postea ex captivis comperit, aut ipsius adventus aut labieni cognitus esset,   considius equo admisso ad eum accurrit, dicit montem, quem a labieno occupari voluerit, ab hostibus teneri: id se a gallicis armis atque insignibus cognovisse."|"non longius] this, the reading of two inferior MSS, is approved by H. and K. F. reads longe mille passibus (without non), so in vni. 36 he has a millibus longe XII. All the best mss have non longe, which makes no good sense."

"NOT FOUND"|"Chap. 47,proposuerat] there is probably an ellipse of sibi, in which case animo is abl."

"NOT FOUND"|"significare] *** give intimations *."

"QUIBUS REBUS adductus caesar non expectandum sibi statuit dum, omnibus fortunis sociorum consumptis, in santonos helvetii pervenirent."|"quibus rebus confectis] Heller asks how it was that Caesar did not take advantage of his partial success, and attack the main body of the Gallic army if as Nap. supposes it was hemmed in between the Romans on the one side and the Loire and the Roman allies, the Aedui, on the other. He agrees with G. that Vercingetorix made a hasty march westward to extricate himself from his dangerous position. In this case he would approach Avaricum from the West and not from the East as he is made to do by Napoleon."

"NOT FOUND"|"p. 41. 3 animi causa] ***for the sake of amusement*. Cf. V. 11 animi voluptatisque causa; Cic. p. Rose. Am. 134 animi et aurium causa. The best MSS have situ causa."

"NOT FOUND"|"tamcn] they had not heard the signal for retreat, but nevertheless they were held in check by their officers."

"NOT FOUND"|"16.	3	animo	defecerat]	***lost heart***. It would appear from these remarks that the Gaulish chieftains were in the habit of absconding in case they met with reverses."

"NOT FOUND"|"Chap. 48."

"interea ea legioNE QUAm secum habebat militibusque, qui ex provincia convenerant, a lacu lemanno, qui in flumen rhodanum influit, ad montem iuram, qui fines sequanorum ab helvetiis dividit, milia passuum xviiii murum in altitudinem pedum sedecim fossamque perducit."|"ne qua] on the form qua cf. Kenn. ** 68, note. The clause ne... oreretur depends on veritus, ***fearing lest***; the clause ut...curaret follows on excepit, *** he received them in such a way as to take care ***: the word sic should perhaps be inserted before silentio; there is some trace of it in the mss."

"NOT FOUND"|"6 Senones, etc.] these tribes (omitting the Aulerci) have left traces of their names in the towns of Sens, Paris, Poitiers (province Poitou), Cahors and Quercy, Tours (province Touraine), Limoges (province Limousin), Angers sur Mayenne (province Anjou). Of the Aulerci there were 4 divisions, the Aul. Brannovices (Briennois), Diablintes, Cenomani, Eburovices (chief town Evreux)."

"at hostes, ubi primum nostros equites conspexerunt, quorum erat v milium numerus, cum ipsi non amplius dccc equites haberent, quod ii qui frumentandi causa erant trans mosam profecti nondum redierant, nihil timentibus nostris, quod legati eorum PAULO ANTE a caesare discesserant atque is dies indutiis erat ab his petitus, impetu facto celeriter nostros perturbaverunt;  rursus his resistentibus consuetudine sua ad pedes desiluerunt subfossis equis compluribus nostris deiectis reliquos in fugam coniecerunt atque ita perterritos egerunt ut non prius fuga desisterent quam in conspectum agminis nostri venissent."|"paullo ante tertiam vigiliam]	cf. n. on 3."

"NOT FOUND"|"perpetuae] ***continuous***, cf. 23, 57. Caesar does not say how many trenches there were, hue ***into these***, cf. the use of eo in 58."

"NOT FOUND"|"Chap. 76."

"NOT FOUND"|"m.p. xxx] possibly near Serbannes: Nap."

"NOT FOUND"|"22 Bibracti] Bibracte was on M. Beuvray 12 or 13 miles W. of Autun. For the case cf. n. on 10."

"eos impeditos et inopinantes adgressus magnam partem eorum concidit; reliqui sese fugae mandarunt ATQUE IN proximas silvas abdiderunt."|"atque in fugam] atque*** *** and so***, cf. atque pervenit 11 end."

"ita dies circiter xv iter fecerunt uti inter novissimum hostium agmen et nostrum primum NON AMPLIUS quinis aut senis milibus passuum interesset."|"non amplius digitis quattuor] ***not more than three inches***, digitus ***finger***s-breadth***."

"NOT FOUND"|"abiuncto] ***abiungcre is only used here in Caesar and very seldom elsewhere*** K. Perhaps the only other certain instance of the word is Verg. Georg, ill. 518 : the passage in Cic. Ep. Att. II. 1. 3 is supposed by some to be spurious."
