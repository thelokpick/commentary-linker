He built vessels, formed sailors, and taught them to secure the Breton ships by using grappling-irons and cutting their ropes.

The besieged, hard pressed and suffering from scarcity of provisions, vigorously second the efforts of their friends without Caesar***s intrenchments, but to no purpose. Violent contests serve only to confirm the superiority of the Romans, and draw on the final result. At last, in despair, Vercingetorix and Alesia surrender."

Even among the Romans, as we learn from the book De Bell. Hisp. a slave was burnt alive, because he had murdered his master. And in this punishment Vossius discerns the same analogy; for, as he who aims at sovereign power is an enemy of the commonwealth, so he is an enemy to a private family who kills its master.

"NOT FOUND"|"T *** Testudine. The name testudo was applied to the covering made by a close body of soldiers, who placed their shields over their heads to secure themselves against the darts of the enemy. The shields fitted so closely together, as to present one unbroken surface, without any interstices between them, and were also so firm that men could walk upon them, and even horses and chariots be driven over them. A testudo was formed (testudinem facere) either in battle, to ward off the arrows and other missiles of the enemy, or which was more frequently the case, to form a protection to the soldiers when they advanced to the walls or gates of a town, for the purpose of attacking them. Sometimes the shields were so arranged as to make the testudo slope. The soldiers in the first line stood upright, those in the second stooped a little, and each line successively was a little lower than the preceding down to the last, where the soldiers rested on one knee. This was called fastigata testudo. See An- thon***s Smith***s Dicty. of Greek and Rom. Antiq. p. 965.***Portas succe- dunt. This verb takes an accus. as well as datFacile, i. e. without danger."

"NOT FOUND"|"lO* Aries. The battering-ram was the chief engine in the attack of places, and was of two sorts, the one rude and plain, the other artificial and compound. The former was nothing more than a large beam, which the soldiers bore on their arms and shoulders, and with one end of it, by main force, assailed the wall. The compound one was a long beam like the mast of a ship, armed at one end with iron in the form of a ram***s head. It was suspended by the middle with ropes and chains, fastened to the beam that lay across two posts; hanging thus equally balanced, it was thrust forward by a number of men, aud drawn back: this was continued until the wall was battered down. The men who worked the ram were protected by a wooden roof over the machine, so as to form a *** testudo.*** The besieged made various efforts to defend their walls against the force of this tremendous instrument of attack. They attempted to set it on fire ; they threw down great stones, so as to break off the iron head of the ram ; caught the head of it in a noose, or a large pair of forceps armed with teeth, (called the lupus;) interposed bags of chaff or soft materials between the wall and the ram, &c. The Romans usually allowed terms to a town which surrendered before the ram began to play ; after that they had to endure the consequences of a storm.

He sent forward some officers to select a site for a camp on the west bank of the Sambre. The opposite bank of the river (at that point only three feet in depth) was crowned by a wood, in which the Nervian forces were posted, and which Caesar had neglected to reconnoitre. Before he had time to take his position, the Nervii issued from the wood, in so great numbers, and with such celerity, that both the general and his legions were taken by surprise.

Simul et ad speciem, et quo tenaciores eorum in proelio* essent metu damni. In the most ancient times of Greece, shields had figures embossed or painted on them, not for mere ornament, but for good omens of success in war, and to strike terror into the enemy: see the description of shields in Euripides*** Phoenissae.

When it is remembered that the object of all this profusion was the enslaving of his country, and that the means which enabled him to practise it were derived from the unprovoked pillage of the towns and temples of Gaul, and the sale of those unfortunate barbarians, who in the course of his unjust wars became his prisoners, it may be justly doubted whether the life of any individual recorded in history, was ever productive of a greater amount of human misery, or has been marked with a deeper stain of wickedness.*** Arnold***s Later Roman Commonwealth, p. 224."

Naves longas. Ships or galleys of war were called naves longae, because they were of a longer shape than those of burden, (naves onerariae,) which were more round and deep: the ships of war were chiefly propelled by oars, the ships of burden by sails. The ships of war were variously named from their rows or banks of oars: those having twoGoogle226*******59 banks, were called biremes; three, triremes; four, quadriremes; five, quinquiremes or penteres. The Romans seldom had ships of more than five banks of oars, and therefore those of six or seven are called by a Greek name, hexeres, hepteres; and above that, by a circumlocution, naves octo, novem, &c., ordinum or versuum. The rowers are generally supposed to have been placed above one another, on different stages or benches on the side of the ship, not in a perpendicular line, but in the form of a quincunx. The oars of the lowest bench were the shortest, and those of the other benches were longer in proportion to their height from the water. There were three different classes of rowers: the first sat in the highest part of the ship, near the stern; the second, in the middle; and the last, in the lowest part, next the prow. Critics, however, differ widely as to the number of oars and rowers, the arrangement of the mariners, &c. See An- thon***s Smith***s Dicty. of Greek and Rojn. Antiq., article *** Ships.***Remiges. Slaves were generally employed by the Romans as rowers and mariners. The average number of men in a war galley of ordinary size was two hundred. From the ancient accounts, it seems that they propelled the galleys with very surprising swiftness. Consult Au- thon***s Smith***s Dicty. of Greek and Rom. Antiq. pp. 889-895."

Juram* Critics have been much perplexed with this passage, which at first sight seems to state what was the reverse of the fact. The Rhone in reality flows into the lake, and not the lake into the river; hence some emend thus: quem in fiumen Rhodanum influit, i. e., 44 into which the river Rhone flows;*** but not well.* Dr. Schmitz explains the matter in this way: 44 We do not say that a lake through which a river flows, flows into the river, but that the river flows into the lake. But Caesar seems to have had in view the point at which the river comes out of the lake, and where a portion of the water of the lake flows out along with the river, and accordingly into the river. Com** pare lib. VII. 57.*** A greater difficulty relates to the position of the wall and ditch which Caesar constructed. If we render, 44 he draws a wall, Ac., from the lake Leman to Mount Jura,*** we find that that could not have been the case, since the cutting down of the bridge would have been a positive injury to Caesar, as interrupting the communication between his camp and the country on the other side of the river; besides, towards the end of the chapter we learn that the Helvetii endeavored to cross the river in boats, &C-, which shows that the wall was on the southern bank of the Rhone, and not from the northwest corner of the lake to the mountain; and lastly, had this been the situation of the wall, the narrow passage between the Rhone and the mountain (cap. 6) would have been blocked up, whereas it is stated (cap. 9) that notwithstanding the wall, this had been left free, and (cap. 11) that the Helvetii actually marched out of their country through it Ad montem Juram, hence, may he rendered 44 in the direction of or towards Mount Jura,*** along the southern bank of the Rhone.
