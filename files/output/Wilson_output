It is difficult to see how this verb applies either to (1) or (2); for it would be the trabs, not the fibulae, that would hold the pairs of piles apart. There is some small MS. authority for destinabantur (*** were fixed***), which would make good sense with (1) and (2). On the whole, as there is no authority for fibulae***cross-stays (3), it is best to take them in their natural meaning, (1) or (2), and to explain distinebantur to mean that the fibulae, by securing the trabs (which really held the pairs of tigna apart) at each end between the tigna, are said themselves to keep them apart.
