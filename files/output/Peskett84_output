"NOT FOUND"|"A brief recapitulation of the chief incidents of this battle may be useful. The two armies were encamped on rising ground on opposite sides of the Sambre near Maubeuge, the Belgae on the SE., the Romans on the NW., bank. The Atrebates occupied the right of the Belgic position, to one looking towards the river, the Viromandui the centre and the Nervii the left. The right of the Roman position (opposite the Nervii) was occupied by the Vllth and Xllth legions, the centre by the Vlllth and Xlth, the left (opposite the Atrebates) by the ixth and xth; the xillth and xivthwere in charge of the baggage-train some distance behind. The battle began by the Roman cavalry crossing the river and engaging the Belgic cavalry. While these were skirmishing the Belgae caught sight of the Roman baggage-train appearing some way off over the crest of the opposite hill: acting on a preconcerted plan they at once broke from their positions, scattered the Roman cavalry, crossed the river and burst with terrific fury upon the Roman legions on the opposite side. The latter, encouraged by Caesar, sustained the attack as well as they could. Soon the ixth and xth succeeded in driving back the Atrebates across the river, crossed it themselves and attacked and actually occupied the Belgic camp: about the same time the vuith and Xlth had driven the Viromandui down the slope and were fighting on the banks of the river; thus the whole of the front and left of the Roman position was left unprotected. The Nervii seeing this divided their attack, their right making an assault on the front of the Roman camp, while their left went to the left of the vnth and xnth legions (with whom it will be remembered that the Nervii were engaged) in order to take them on their right and exposed flank (latus apertum). At this time the Xillth and xivthwere coming up behind at a rapid pace, and, besides this, Labienus with the ixth and xth on the opposite bank, seeing the critical state of affairs, hastened to recross the river. This double succour in front and behind completely turned the day, and the Nervii notwithstanding their magnificent bravery were utterly routed."

"NOT FOUND"|"Bibrax] as Caesar***s camp is admitted to have been situated near the village of Berry-au-Bac, the site of Bibrax must be sought at a distance of 8 Roman miles therefrom. Goler places it at Beaurieux, a small village about a mile from the north bank of the Aisne, and at about the requisite distance from Berry-au-Bac; others, Napoleon, Kampen, etc., prefer Vieux Laon, a small waste plateau, about 12 miles east of Laon.

"NOT FOUND"|"circuitu] Napoleon is no doubt right in his view that the circuit of 50 or 60 miles means the detour, which it would be necessary to make from the straight line of march in order to avoid the narrow valley of the Doubs.

"NOT FOUND"|"conducendos] conducere is here ***to hire*, in the next chapter it is used in its ordinary sense of ***gather together***: the present passage shows how easily the one meaning passes into the other."

"NOT FOUND"|"Noviodunum] two other places of this name are mentioned in the B. G., cf. VII. 12, 55. It is generally supposed that our Noviodunum occupied the site of the town of Soissons though Desjardins hesitates to affirm this : M. Peigne-Delacourt places it at Noyon where there are clear traces of a Gaulish oppidum, but the distance of this place from Berry-au-Bac, between 40 and 50 Roman miles, adds greatly to the difficulties of the narrative; besides, as Desjardins says, Caesar would in that case have mentioned the passage of the Oise. The Suessiones had 12 oppida and it is probable that more than one of these may have been named Noviodunum which appears to be equivalent to the name now so common in this part of France *** Neuf-chateau cf. such widespread names as Neapolis, Newtown, Newton, Neuville, Neustadt, etc."

"NOT FOUND"|"Labienus]	It was the forces of Labienus which Considius mistookfor Gauls. Caesar, though he had also taken up his position on a hill (copias in proximum collem subducit) evidently could not see the hill held by Labienus, for it was only later in the day that he learnt from scouts that Considius*** report was false, and that it was the Romans and not the Gauls that occupied the hill in question."

"NOT FOUND"|"P. 7, 1. 4, lintribus] lintres were roughly constructed flat-bottomed boats of the ferry-boat type. An earlier form of the word is lunter which may have lost a p, thus corresponding to the Greek irXuvrrip though with a different meaning."

The distance following the bend of the river is, judging from Baron Stoffel***s report, 32 kilometres; hence Desjardins, who corrects Napoleon***s error in saying that the distance, following the river line, was 28 kilometres, errs himself when he says that the distance by the river line is at least one-third more than the distance in a straight line. Napoleon shows that there is no need to suppose the line of fortification to have been continuous from the lake of Geneva to the pass: for some distance the ground on the south bank is too precipitous to require any artificial strengthening; there were only five points where such defensive works were necessary, one opposite the village of Russin, the others at or near the villages of Cartigny, Avully, Chancy and Cologny. It has been conclusively shown by Napoleon and Baron Stoffel that by murus fossaque must not be understood a wall in the ordinary sense of the term, flanked by a ditch, but by murus Caesar means simply the scarp of a fosse, dug along the steep face of the hill; the scarp of such a ditch would naturally be nearly or quite twice the altitude of the counterscarp.

This hill, of an oblong shape, is steep and almost inaccessible on the SE. and SW. sides; on the NW. side the ground is less precipitous, being broken by a few ravines, while on the NE. the plateau, instead of terminating in an abrupt fall, has a gently-descending slope for some little distance, after which the ground again rises till it merges with the range of hills covered with the Bois du Huy; the width of this end where the slope begins is about 230 feet; this is a sufficiently near approximation to the width of 200 feet given by Caesar.

Goler on the contrary retains quinque, and imagines Caesar to mean the 111 which is a tributary of the Rhine."

"NOT FOUND"|"32 castra movent] Napoleon thinks with great probability that the Gauls, after crossing the Saone, followed the line of the subsequent Roman road from Lyon to Autun, which was no doubt only an improvement of an old Gallic road. This route would take them through or ' near Belleville, Avenas, Cluny, and St Vallier, where it is supposed that they quitted the Autun road and turned westward, passing through Issy l***Eveque, Remilly, etc. to Mont Beuvray, near which the decisive battle was fought: cf. 21 sqq. Heller, however, -with whom Kraner agrees, follows de Saulcy in placing the site of the decisive battle near Ivry and Cussy-la-Colonne about 16 or 18 miles N.E. of Autun. In this neighbourhood a number of graves have been found which from various indications are judged to be those of the Helvetii who fell in the battle. Heller makes the Helvetii quit the Saone valley somewhere above Macon (cf. 16) and march into the Charolais hill district, thence north-eastward towards Ivry, passing to the east of Autun. See the case fully argued by Heller in Philol. XIX. 557 sqq., XXVI. 657 sqq."

"NOT FOUND"|"Sequanos] the Sequani were situated between the Rhine where it turns eastward at Basle, the Saone, the Rhone and M. Jura. One of the possible routes into Gaul, Caesar says, lay through their territory, and to enter this the Helvetii would have to pass between the Jura and the Rhone along a defile which reaches its narrowest point at the Fort de l***ficluse, about 13 miles from Geneva, built in the xivth century to command this entrance into France. No route from Helvetia into Gaul across the Jura seems to have been known, to the Romans at any rate, at this time; at present the Jura may be crossed at several points. It is not quite clear why the Helvetii could not have gone by the Trouee de Belfort."

"NOT FOUND"|"9 vidit] this, like the vidit in line 1, follows on ubi. The greater part of this chapter from the beginning to uti possent consists of one long sentence made up of a protasis ubi suos...submitti posset and an apodosis scuto...uti possent, to which also belong the words Caesar...profectus at the beginning of the chapter: thus the second vidit would have been sufficient by itself, but the insertion of the first vidit makes the sentence easier to understand."

"QUID SIBI vellet?"|"quid sibi vellet cur...veniret] ***what was his object in coming?*** Kraner divides the sentence into two questions quid sibi vellet ? cur... veniret ?"

"NOT FOUND"|"pollicitum) the joke lies in the ***double entendre***: ad equum reseri- bere might mean either 4 to degrade to the rank of cavalry ***, or *** to advance to the rank of equites ***, which in earlier times, when the cavalry consisted of equites Kotnani, amounted to the same thing, whereas in Caesar***s army there was no Roman cavalry. As a cohors praetoria (cf. 40 end) they were degraded by being turned into a cavalry regiment, while as legionarii milites, which was their real position, they were honoured by being advanced to the dignity of equites.
