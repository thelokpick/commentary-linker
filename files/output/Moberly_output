Mr. Long remarks on the difficulty of making men riders extempore; but Vegetius (1. 18) asserts that, even up to his time,4 salitio equorum non tironibus modo, sed etiam militibus districte est semper exacta.* The context shews that he means infantry. If we suppose that Vegetius, as in some other cases, is here drawing on his own imagination, the feat of the Germans in teaching navvies to ride adequately in three days for the purpose of blowing down the bridge at Bitche is a notable instance of the possibility of doing what Caesar does here."

Thus the end of the flood and the beginning of the ebb were.occupied by Caesar***s fleet in dropping down the harbour; and the fleet was ready to sail by midnight[2.] hora quarta: he reached the Dover shore at about 8.30 (the first hour at this season was at 5.6), and then rode at anchor, for his transports to come up, till about 3.30.

This has to be distinguished from two kinds of dientship existing under the republican governments; first the voluntary gathering round a rich man like Orgetorix, and secondly the voluntary combinations formed in the towns against the nobles who wished to reduce them to their old dependence (Thierry, book 4, c. 1)."

[3.] magno cum periculo provinciae futurum, ut... haberet. The periphrasis with 4 futurum esse* or4 fore,*** and the subjunctive, instead of the future infinitive 4 sese habiturum/ often indicates that the result expected will spring from various causes unspecified.

"sic omnibus hostium copiis FUSIS ARMISQUE exutis se intra munitiones suas recipiunt."|"1. 32. [3.] fusis armisque exutis, both participles agree with *** hostium copiis/ and *** armis*** is the ablative of material; 4 the forces of the enemy being routed and stripped of their arms.* 4 Hostem armis exuere*** is, as Kraner remarks, so frequent an expression that the awkwardness of the ablative on ablative is not felt.

"NOT FOUND"|"1. aa. [3.] Aduatucam. This ha3 been identified with Tongres. The reasons for doing so are given at length in Jules Clsar (vol. a, p. 201, note), ard are in substance that no other place satisfies the necessary conditions. The two principal objections would be that Tongres was by no means in the centre of the Eburonian territory, and that Caesar makes no mention of crossing the Meuse on this march. But the ford of Vis4 was probably well known even then; so that the passage of the Meuse would not call for any peculiar notice; and a military man would take his idea of a central position more from the roads than from the general country which he occupies. Thus Tongres would be a * medius locus,' as lying on the great arterial road of the Meuse, by which alone the baggage of the army could be transported. Note that Aduatuca must not be confounded with the Aduatum of a. 29, note I, which is the citadel of Namur."

"NOT FOUND"|"divinities. Thus Jupiter is probably Taranis, the god of thunder, for ***taran* is Celtic for thunder. Mercury is Teutates (Luw Taith, the god of travelling'): and this name closely resembles the name of Thoth, by which the same divinity, the author of all arts, was known in the East (Plato, Phaedr. ** 274). The god whom Caesar calls Mars was Hesus. A figure of him and one probably of Taranis are given from antique sources in the Piet. Hist, of England, vol. 1, p. 68. See also the passage of Lucan quoted at 6. 13."

"NOT FOUND"|"1. 18. [7.] Curiosolitae, round Dinan and S. Malo. Several MSS. read *** Venelli * for * Esuvii/ which the author of Jules Cesar follows. The sense thus given is better; for the Esuvii were in eastern Normandy about Falaise, whereas the Venelli, occupying the Cotentin from Avranches to Cape la Hogue, are more naturally involved in this Breton war. The three nations here named extend quite across the peninsula of Bretagne."

"qua re nuntiata caesar omnibus consiliis ANTEVERTENDUM EXISTIMAVIT, ut narbonem proficisceretur."|"1. 18. [4.] antevertendum existimavit, a slightly antiquated expression.

Even in the summer the passage offered some difficulty to an army, as we see from the dfoour made by the Helvetii to avoid it in Book 1. c. 12; and from the fact that the high road from Lyons to Rochelle passed (before railways were made) by Autun, Nevers, and thence along the Loire."

"caesar iis quos in castris retinuerat DISCEDENDI POTESTATEM fecit."|"1. 30. [2.] discedendi potestatem fecit.

Compare his different treatment of the Breton senate, whom he did think guilty (3. 16), though he admits that they were so only on compulsion."

This account is clear enough when the passage is read as in the text; and the geographical difficulties will much diminish if we state briefly what is known about the Delta of theNOTES. BOOK IV, CHAP. IIRhine. It is plain, in the first place, from geological evidence (Esquiros, The Dutch at Home, p. 8), that the Rhine must have been at some time or other a vast body of water directing itself towards the sea by way of Leyden and what is now the Zuyder Zee, and at times covering with its waters a large part of Utrecht, Overyssel, and Guelderland. Advancing in this direction it would meet the maximum force of the German Ocean (see 5. 7, note 3); which would gradually (as the climate of Europe became milder and the river lost volume) succeed in gaining upon the Rhine and silting up its outlets in this direction. Thus the stream would be driven farther south in search of an issue. In the time of the Roman emperors a balance still seems to have existed between the volume of water conveyed by the northern and southern mouths, the Waal and the Rhine. For we find Civilis, the insurgent Batavian, destroying a dam raised by Drusus near the embranchment of these two rivers. The object of the dam seems to have been to keep the waters from the Waal channel and direct them to the old Rhine; that of Civilis to move the frontier of his country farther soutij by drawing them back to the Waal."

Caesar here sums up with admirable brevity the grounds which induced him to go to war with Ariovistus. To complete the view of the status, some other facts, however, must be taken into account. The Sequani had originally attacked the Aedui (and called in Ariovistus to their help), because of the tyranny exercised by them in laying excessive tolls on the dried meat trade of the Saone mentioned above. Shortly after this battle, in B.C. 61, the Roman senate, in order to guard against the expected Helvetian invasion, had sent messengers to the chief Gallic cities to induce them to oppose it; and in pursuance of this object had passed the decree for the protection of the Aedui and other allied states, to which Caesar refers in chap. 35, a step which, taken so late as it was, showed but little * fraternal*** affection (Cic. ad Att. 1. 18). At the same moment, and with the same object, they sent confidential messengers to Ariovistus, saluting him as 4 rex et populi Romani amicus/ recognising thus his claims on Gaul, and according to Plutarch, inviting him to Rome (Vita Caes. 19). In this manner they persuaded him not to favour the Helvetian invasion; but their duplicity in allying themselves with oppressed and oppressor at once led to its natural consequences in the war now to be narrated."

But Caesar probably did not know this: and thus the present may have seemed to him a favourable opportunity for pushing his arms into the only part of Gaul to which the Roman standards had not yet penetrated. Crassus* cavalry, too, would have been useless in a Breton war; and were therefore available for other purposes. It should be remarked that the Aquitanian tribes did not join even in the great revolt of Book vii; and their connections were far more with Spain than with Gaul, see below, chap. 20: while the Armori- cans on their side, as Merivale remarks (vol. i, p. 343), took little interest in southern affairs."

BOOK II, CHAP. 1-3,enough the Volcae of Languedoc, though living so far to the south of the main seats of their nation, are thought to be a Belgian tribe; their name being held to be only another form of Belgae.

Leaving in each camp a small Roman force, Caesar drew up his alarii (the auxilia of chap. 49) before the smaller camp, in such a manner as to make it appear that the two legions were there still. But, meanwhile, these legions had been withdrawn, and crossing the space of three miles, unobserved by the enemy, had joined the four legions belonging to the larger camp, and made an attack on Ariovistus*** position before he could call in his detachments. Of course the successful execution of such a stratagem depended largely upon the perfect steadiness behind ramparts of the two legions who had first occupied the smaller camp (thus being left in the rear), and then executed the hazardous movement from camp to camp. This explanation is due to Jules C6sar, vol. 2, p. 91."

The excavations seem to prove that one of these ditches ran from the south-east angle of the camp to the Aisne, the other from the north-west angle nearly to the Miette. But this would be placing them both on the right of the position; whereas the text seems to indicate that they guarded both flanks; and, taking it alone, we should certainly think that they were drawn at right angles to the right and left of Caesar***s line, and on both sides towards the enemy. Perhaps the solution may be that the two ditches given in plate 8 to Jules C6sar, together constituted the right-hand ditch of the two mentioned by Caesar (their combined length would have been about 600 paces); and another similar ditch (effaced or not discovered) may have been drawn at right angles to the left of the position, crossing from river to river, in a length of 600 paces, as the eastern one did, by the help of the intervening camp. The word * transversam* seems of itself to imply that the ditches crossed the axis of the hill."

Was there a *** sectio eius oppidi universa' (see the similar case in 2. 33), or did the growing fierceness of the conflict produce even fiercer measures ? The omission of all details makes us imagine that Caesar wished not to relate another tragedy like what he had to tell of Avaricum."

Orosius' explanation is, that they formed a kind of tortoise, with their shields over their heads; and that some of the Roman soldiers sprang actually on this roof of shields.

This learned writer points out that Basque (or Iberian) districts may be known by the occurrence of the syllables ***ast/ a rock, ***uria,* a town, ***itur/ a fountain, and some others. Thus Calagurris, Asturia, Turiga, would be Basque names. For the character of the people, see Michelet, Hist, de France, vol. *, p. aga."

The terror which the name of Gaul inspired at Rome has been already noticed (2. 35, note 4); and how roughly the British Celts had handled Caesar we may judge from the fact that in starting on this campaign Caesar's two legions which had just returned from Britain contained together only 7000 men (chap. 49). When, therefore, Dr. Prichard says (Hist, of Mankind, vol. 3, p. 179) that the Celtic nations were always defeated when they came into collision with the Germans, and when this fact is treated as a corroboration of the accounts of their immorality, we ought to enquire whether Roman protectorates rather than national customs did not enfeeble the Gauls and make them incapable of resistance. Such is Tacitus' view (Agric. u)."

[3.] laqueis falces avertebant. The ***falces* seem to have been a kind of battering ram with both a point and a hook. See Jules C6sar (vol. 2, p. 128, note). The nooses were employed, as in the great siege of Plataea (Thuc. 2. 76), first to break the blow by turning it in an oblique direction, and then by drawing the sliding knot tight, to drag the ram from its position by means (apparently) of windlasses."

"NOT FOUND"|"1. 32.

The' variety in the name may be accounted for by#then?"

"NOT FOUND"|"I. 4. [7.] leporem, gallinam, anserem. The hare, as is well known, was forbidden by the Mosaic law; nor is there any mention in the Bible of chickens and geese as articles of food.

The defeat of the expedition sent from England under Puisaye in 1795 has attached, as regards ourselves, very different memories to the same spot."

Labienus, meanwhile, was to drive the enemy up towards the isle of Bommel. Caesar, with the three remaining legions, went towards Brussels and Antwerp."

Yet the difficulty would be hardly less on the other supposition, as the German cavalry would then have had to get from the lower Meuse to Coblenz in the same time. It is possible either that *** ad eas res conficiendas * may mean *** in order to arrange for the embassy,* or that the ambassadors wildly pressed for these three days without closely considering what they promised to accomplish in them. Or finally, the narrative may be deficient in good faith on Caesar***s part. See theTollowing notes."

All we can say is, that the passage was probably above Teddington, where the river ceases to be tidal; probably not far above it, for Caesar was not likely, with the country about St. Alban***s for his object, to go up higher than he needed. He had probably crossed the Medway at Aylesford, near Maidstone, and the South Downs somewhere near Reigate; and so marched across by way of the present Ewell to Kingston-on-Thames.

BOOK V, CHAP. 1$,	281Man, p. 388) tells us, it is true, of a somewhat similar arrangement among the Tahitians. ***A considerable number,*** he says, ***of the principal people were formed into an association called the *** Arreoy,*** all the' members of which were regarded as being married to one another.

The firing of mere wickerwork would hardly produce a sufficient flame; on the other hand, if the image was placed on a pile of wood, as M.

"NOT FOUND"|"1. 29. [2.] Genava appears from inscriptions to be the right orthography. The word, according to Gluck (Keltische Namen, p. 106), is from 4 gena/ the Celtic word for * mouth ;* and well expresses the position of Geneva, where the green waters of the lake crowd and hurry into the narrowing river course."

"NOT FOUND"|"1. 25. [0. 12. n. 1.] Britanniae pars interior. Caesar***s object in writing these details about Britain is indicated by the curiosity which enlightened men at Rome felt about the island. Thus Cicero writes to his brother Quintus, who commanded one of Caesar***s legions, * modo mihi date Britanniam quam pingam coloribus tuis penicillo meo. . *** Quos tu situs, quas naturas rerum et locorum, quos mores, quas gentes, quas pugnas habes*** (Ad Quint. 2.15, 16).

"cuius mali sors incidit remis, quibus ille dies FUNGENDI MUNERIS obvenerat."|"1. 4. [2.]/fungendi muneris, the gerundive shows that ***fungor* is considered as governing the accusative. This the verb could govern only when its etymological meaning of ***to rid oneself' was forgotten. The genitive case is here objective, *** a day for doing duty.*1. 23. [c. 13.] non solum ii, &c*** not only those of the Gauls who were being cut down or reached by the missiles, but even those whose natural place was with the reserve."

"NOT FOUND"|"1- 25. [7.] perpaucis desideratis. Here the circumstance expressed by the ablative absolute accompanies or follows the main action instead of preceding it. So Livy 4. 10, ***Volsci oppressi dederunt poenas, vix nuntio caedis relicto.*** This is rare."

"quibus rebus confectis, caesar ad oppidum avaricum, quod erat maximum munitissimumque in finibus biturigum atque AGRI FERTILISSIMA regione, profectus est, quod eo oppido recepto civitatem biturigum se in potestatem redacturum confidebat."|"1. 22. [5.] agri fertilissima regione, 'in the most fertile part of the district occupied by them.*** 4 Regio' properly means * a line drawn from the eye onwards,' * a direction' (see above, 6. 25, note 3), and secondarily, * a line bounding a space ;* whence also ' a space,*** * an area.'"

"cum id non impetrassent, petebant uti ad eos [equites] QUI AGMEN antecessissent praemitteret eos pugna prohiberet, sibique ut potestatem faceret in ubios legatos mittendi;  quorum si principes ac senatus sibi iure iurando fidem fecisset, ea condicione quae a caesare ferretur se usuros ostendebant: ad has res conficiendas sibi tridui spatium daret."|"1. 28. [6.] qui agmen hostium claudebant: the Tulingi, who had originally occupied the van of the march, and therefore were left in the rear when the Helvetii suddenly turned to follow Caesar."

"sed hoc quoque factum est,  quod aedificio circumdato silva, ut sunt fere domicilia gallorum, qui vitandi aestus causa plerumque silvarum atque fluminum petunt propinquitates, comites familiaresque eius ANGUSTO IN loco paulisper equitum nostrorum vim sustinuerunt."|"1. 27.

"NOT FOUND"|"L 33. [0. 88.] Nervios; it has been already remarked (2. 28, note)NOTES. BOOK V, CHAP. 39-42,that the destruction of the Nervii as described in that chapter must be exaggerated.. Here we find them with an independent force of their own; and also retaining the command of a confederacy. So in 7. 75, they send 5,000 men to Alesia. See, however, the footnote to 2. 28."
