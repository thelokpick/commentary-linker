On the occasion, in question the division seems to have actually taken place, 370 members voting for Curio***s resolution and 22 against it; but by some means or other the Pompeian party managed to prevent the senatorial decree embodying the terms of the resolution from being passed. The magnum hoc testimonium of the next chapter clearly refers to some decisive expression of opinion on the part of the Senate as a body (universi) in Caesar***s favour, for Hirtius compares it with a similar proceeding of the previous year when the senate voted against a resolution of Marcellus framed in opposition to Caesar***s interests. The testimonium then must be this decisive division in favour of Curio***s motion that Pompey and Caesar should both simultaneously disband their armies, which motion, it must be remembered, was thoroughly approved by Caesar if not actually suggested by him."

The Caleti have perhaps left a trace of their name in the town of St Vallery en Caux in the department of Seine inferieure.

Pompeius Strabo (father of Cn. Pompeius Magnus) in 89. There was a large Keltic element among the inhabitants of the Transpadane district, and when Strabo organised them into settled communities it was thought advisable instead of conferring the full Roman franchise on them at once, to give them temporarily the so-called Latin rights, ius Latii, which, while bestowing on them many privileges, excluded them from voting in elections at Rome and from serving in the legions; but it seems certain that Caesar levied soldiers from them, in which case he must have regarded them as Roman burgesses: ***it is possible***, says Mommsen, ***that Caesar combined with the levy the bestowal of the franchise; but more probably he adhered to the standpoint of his party, which instead of seeking to procure for the Transpadanes the Roman franchise rather regarded it as already legally belonging to them***."

"NOT FOUND"|"locum] the various hints giyen by Hirtius as to the natural features of this locality should make its identification comparatively easy. It is usually placed on the south bank of the Aisne about 3 miles to the eastwards of its junction with the Oise. A little stream, the Ru de Berne, here flows into the Aisne. The converging course of this streamlet and the river forms a neck of land from 2 to 3 kilometres across. The ground is of sufficient elevation to be called a hill and bears the name of M. St Marc : between M. St Marc and the river is a narrow tract of level ground along which runs the road from Compi&gne to Soissons; on the south side of the Ru de Berne, and separated by it from M. St Marc, is M. St Pierre. Beyond these to the eastward, the Ru de Berne takes its rise in some low marshy ground in which are several small lakes, one of them perhaps 500 yards in length; the whole course of the Ru de Berne is fringed by marshes. On M. St Marc in the neck of land between the Aisne and the Ru de Berne it is generally supposed that the Bellovaci were encamped, while the Romans occupied M. St Pierre about one kilometre to the south. Almost between the two hills and bisected by the streamlet lies the village of Vieux-Moulin. To the south and west extends the vast Foret de Compi&gne. On St Pierre is a ruined church, and there are distinct traces of a Roman encampment of which the tourist will find mention in Baedeker***s Paris p. 322. A summary of the different views held on the subject of this campaign will be found in Desjardins II. 718 note. M. Desjardins himself despairs of a definite solution."

It issued from the west face of the rock and flowed into the Tourmente. But here a difficulty arises, for Hirtius says that it was on the side where for the space of 300 feet there was a break in the circuit of stream; but this break was on the opposite side and was moreover about a Roman mile in length. Hence Hirtius either makes a mistake, which is quite possible, or we may follow Kampen in supposing that he wrote intervallo rupium and not intervallo fluminis, a conjecture based on the fact that from the position occupied by the Roman camps the Puy dTssolu actually does appear on that side for a distance of exactly 300 feet to be without the steep escarpment which runs round it, elsewhere of visible abruptness, as one may see from the views in Napoleon***s Atlas, but just here of lower height and partially or entirely hidden from view."

Ferd. Becher points out in Philol. xlii. 409 that tam operose almost = quamvis operose, since ***opera is not the tertium comparationis but facultas atque elegantia scribendi***.
