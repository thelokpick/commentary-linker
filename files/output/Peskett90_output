"EST BOS cervi figura, cuius a media fronte inter aures unum cornu exsistit excelsius magisque directum his, quae nobis nota sunt, cornibus:  ab eius summo sicut palmae ramique late diffunduntur."|"27 est bos cervi figura] the reindeer, rangifer tarandus. With respect to Caesar***s use of the word bos I quote the following from a paper on the Zoology of Ancient Europe read by Prof. Newton before the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1862: ***Caesar begins his notice of this animal in the words est bos cervi figura% and it is remarkable that in Sweden and Norway, where it yet flourishes, the terms bull, cow, and ox, are at the present day always applied to the Rein-Deer, instead of hart or hind, buck or doe. So also in the fur countries of North America, where a form perhaps not to be distinguished from the European species occurs, the same peculiarity obtains, since it is known as the Carriboo or Carr^-bceuf, a corruption of Cerf-bceuf or ***stag-ox*.*** When the Romans made their first acquaintance with elephants in Lucania they called them Lucae boves. For the substance of most of the notes on this and the two following chapters, I am indebted to Prof. Newton. In prehistoric times the reindeer was found over a great part of Europe, and in the south of France was so abundant that the age in which it flourished is known among palaeontologists as the Reindeer Period.

"NOT FOUND"|"quoniam...remaneret] this clause forms a part of Caesar***s application to Pompey and contains one of the reasons for that application, hence the subjunctive remaneret; cf. 7.

At this time he was nominally occupied with the management of the corn supply but was really engaged in watching the progress of political events at Rome. Being still in possession of the military imperium he could not actually enter the city. Hence Caesar speaks of him as remaining near the city, ad urbem."

A legion and a half (15 cohorts in all) had perished in this disastrous engagement; thus the present addition of three legions, of which one was lent by Pompey, while the other two were levied by Caesar***s legati, just doubled the number of troops that had been lost, cf. Plutarch Caes. xxv, Cato Minor xlv, Pomp. LII, Cic. Fam. vm. 4, Appian B. C. II. 29, [Caesar] B. G. vm. 54. A comparison of these passages will show a strange discrepancy, inasmuch as it is stated in some that Pompey lent Caesar two legions, in others that he lent him one. Plutarch even contradicts himself. Nipperdey has shown to demonstration that Pompey only lent one legion; Goler controverting a similar view held by Drumann writes with great carelessness (Caesar***s Gallischer Krieg p. 205, ed. 2). The new legions were numbered I, xiv, XV, of these I. was lent by Pompey, B. G.

It seems to me, however, a very natural explanation of the difficulties of the passage, if we suppose that Caesar described the animal partly from hearsay and partly from a rude sketch in profile. In the latter case, unless the drawing were in correct perspective the animal would appear to be possessed of one horn only, and therefore he might legitimately describe it in times when a belief in all kinds of monsters was current, as possessed of one horn*. Prof. Newton suggests that Caesar had seen a reindeer***s horns of a not unusual type, having the brow antler on one side extending straight down the middle of the forehead and developed at the expense of the other, which is thus often reduced to a single tine, and that he intended to describe this remarkable appearance. But in that case would not Caesar have written excelsius altero or something similar? I fear Caesar cannot be acquitted of the charge of having described the Reindeer as a ***Unicorn***."

A precisely similar belief, apparently originating with Ktesias of Knidos (nor. 400 6.c.), long prevailed with respect to the Elephant.
