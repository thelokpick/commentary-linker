Even supposing, therefore, that the Gallic tribes, in the vicinity of this place, had acquired a familiarity with, not merely the written characters, but the language of the Greeks themselves (a supposition far from probable), the same cannot certainly be said of the more northern tribes, and among them of the Helvetii. It will be remembered, too, that Caesar, on one occasion (B. G. 5, 48), sent a letter to his lieutenant written in Greek characters, lest it should otherwise, if intercepted, have been read by the Nervii.

Cats. c. 26), Caesar lost his sword in this battle, and the Arverni suspended it in one of their temples. His friends having pointed it out to him on a subsequent occasion, and urging him to have it taken down, he smiled, and declined granting their request, regarding the sword as a thing consecrated to the gods. If the story be true, CsBsar must, as Plutarch remarks, have received some check in the commencement of the action."

Portorium originally signified the duty levied on goods in a harbour (in portu), whence the name. The signification was afterward extended, and, as in the present instance, denoted the tax paid for liberty to carry goods through a particular country."

Compare Vegetius (5, 4): *** Utilius configitur Liburna clavis areis quam ferreis.*** It must be borne in mind, that what we here call brass was, strictly speaking, a kind of bronze. The term as is indiscriminately used by the Roman writers to denote copper, brass, or bronze. It was not till a late period that mineralogists, in order to distinguish them, gave the name of cuprum to copper. The oldest writer who uses the word cuprum is Spartianus (Fi/.

The opponents of this reading consider hunc silvestrem a violation of the grammatical rule of gender; but the truth is, that Caesar here employs, for the sake of perspicuity, the old Latin form dorsus, of the masculine gender.

Strictura, according to Nonius (1, 77, and 12, 23), properly signifies a spark that dies off from a piece of metal struck with the hammer while red hot. It is then applied to a mass of metal in the furnace, and also to a mass of unwrought metal, and it is from this last that a signification is still farther sought to be obtained, about the correctness of which we may well entertain doubts, namely, *** a mass of earth and stone from whkh ore is obtained by means of the furnace.*** This is tfre meaning which the advocates for strictura wish to give it in theNOTES ON THE THIRD BOOK."

Of these two, that which ed into the province most required the attention of CiBsar; and as he could not expect to keep off the vast numbers of the Helvetii by the small force which he had with him, he drew a wall along the lower bank of the Rhone, in a line with the fords, from the point where the Lake of Geneva emptied into that river, to the spot where the Rhone divides, as it were, the chain of Jura into two parts, and forms the pass already mentioned between the river and the mountain.

It is difficult to conceive, that their leading men would have put themselves so completely into the hands of the Romans, had their object been a treacherous one. On the other hand, Plutarch informs us (Vil. Coes. c. 12, seq.), that Cato actually charged Caesar with a violation of good faith on this occasion, and was for giving him up to the enemy. (Compare Sueton. Vit. Jul. c. 24.) The breach of good faith with which Cato charged him, seems to have consisted jn his attacking the Germans while he had their ambassadors with him ; more especially since Dio Cassius informs us (39, 47, seq.\ that the battle was owing to the uncontrollable ardour of the youngei warriors among the Germans, which their elders disapproved of to such a degree, as to send an embassy to Caesar far the purpose of explaining what had been done. This embassy, therefore, Caesar detained, and, in the mean time, marched against and conquered those for whom they had come to intercede."

Then the priest of the canton, if the occasion be public ; if private, the master of the family ; after an invocation of the gods, with his eyes lifted up to heaven, thrice takes out each piece, and, as they come up, interprets their signification according to the marks fixed upon them.

A singular specimen of critical acumen ! just as if the relative position of the Ubii and Suevi had anything to dc with the theatre of the war between Caesar and Ariovistus. A strong argument in favour of the reading Ubii may be obtained from the 37th chapter of this book, where the Treviri, the immediate neighbours of the Ubii, came to Caesar with the intelligence, that the Suevi were endeavouring to cross the Rhine in their vicinity. The Ubii, moreover, as appears from another part of these commentaries (4, 3), were old enemies of the Suevi. Davies, Clarke, Oudendorp, and many other editors, declare in favour of Ubii as a reading, which was first given by Rhenanus and Hotomannus on conjecture. The Greek paraphrast has also ol OMtot."

The term Soldurii is supposed to be of Celtic origin, soldure, and the same with the Welsh sawldwr, with which terms also the French soldat is connected, although some would derive it from the pay received, a solidis, vel a soldo. The other reading, Saldunas, finds some support from the language of Athenaeus (6, 54), who, in quoting from Nicolaus Damascenus, calls the persons referred to in our text EiXofofoovf, which Schweighaeuser, however, has changed to EiXoAofyovf, in order to reconcile it with the received text of Caesar. It is worthy of remark, moreover, that in the Basque language Saldi means *** a horse,*** and Salduna ***a cavalier.*** Still, as ZtXo&otpovs is explained in Athenaeus by <6;goA</ia/oo$, which is equivalent to the Latin devotos, the reading Soldurios must not be disturbed.

A Cimbro-Teutonic horde, the same that were afterward defeated by Marius, after devastating central Gaul, united with the Helvetii, and resolved to attack the Roman province simultaneously at different points. The Tigurini, a tribe of the Helvetii, under the command of Divico, undertook to invade the territory of the Allobroges by the bridge of Geneva and the fords of the Rhone a little below this city. The rest of the Helvetii, together with their new allies, moved south. This plan of operations compelled the Romans to divide their forces. The Consul Cassius hastened to Geneva, while his lieutenant Scaurus made head against the Cimbri and Teutones. Both commanders were unfortunate. Cassius and his army were cut to pieces by the Helvetii on the borders of the Lacus Lemannus, or Lake of Geneva; while Scaurus was defeated and taken prisoner by those whom he had endeavoured to oppose.
