"NOT FOUND"|"21 Vocatium et Tarusatium] we have no means of ascertaining the exact position of these tribes. Desjardins suggests that the Vocates may be identified with the tivitas Vasatica of the ***Notitia Provinciarum***, and with the Vassei of Pliny who also mentions among the Aquitanian communities a tribe of Basaboiates or Basabocates, the latter part of whose name suggests the Vocates of Caesar. The Vasates appear to have left their name in Bazas a town in the department of Gironde. The Tarusates are doubtfully identified by Desjardins with the Toruates of Pliny with the suggestion that they may be the same as the Aturenses of the Notitia, whose name survives in Adura (Aire) on the Adour in the department of Landes It will be noticed that supposing this identification to be correct the Vocates and Tarusates lie to the N. and S. respectively of the Sotiates (Sos), a view scarcely supported by Caesar***s way of speaking of them."

The Cocosates (.sexsignani, Pliny) mentioned below were probably a small tribe dependent on the Tarbelli occupying the district near Castets in Landes."

For the double genitive, cf. I. 19 sine eius offensione animi; 11. 17 eorum dierum consuetudine itineris. The double genitive in 17 summam imperii civitatum is not quite similar."

"NOT FOUND"|"Britanniam] there seems to have been a good deal of intercourse between Gaul and Britain in Caesar***s time though the Gauls knew little of the interior of the island. It was visited chiefly by merchants who confined their traffic to the dwellers on the coast: IV. 20. The Britons usually furnished auxiliaries in the Gallic wars : infra 9, IV. 20. In VI. 13 Caesar tells us that the cultus of the Druids originated in Britain and that those who desired a more accurate acquaintance with its mysteries were in the habit of visiting the island for that purpose."

"NOT FOUND"|"Nantuates] from 6 we learn that the Nantuates were situated between the Veragri, whose chief town was Octodurus (Martigny), and the Allobroges, and therefore occupied the valley of the Rhone between S. Maurice and Villeneuve. Hence it is difficult to suppose that they are identical with the tribe of the same name mentioned in iv. 10 as bordering on the Rhine near its source : see my note on that passage. M. Desjardins suggests with some probability that the original tribe may have been broken up into two portions at the time of the migration of one of the four Helvetic cantons, the pagus Tigurinus; cf. I. 12."

From Caesar***s description alone one could scarcely tell whether the 600 were severally bound by ties of loyalty and affection to their king, and lived and died with him, or whether they consisted of pairs of devoted friends owning a general allegiance to the king, in which case one might compare them to the sacred band of Thebes.

He says that Caesar is referring to the flow of the tide which continues for 6 hours, after which the ebb prevails for another 6 hours and then the flood-tide recommences : thus Caesar is correct in saying that in the space of 12 hours the flow of the tide (aestus se ex alto incitans) is twice in progress: e.g. supposing it to be low water at 12 noon it will be high water about 6 p. m., low water again shortly after midnight; then at, say, 4 p. m. the tide will be flowing and it will again be flowing at 1 or 2 a. m.; that is, it will be twice flowing within the space of 12 hours. Caesar thus emphasises the shortness of time within which his operations had to be carried on, the enemies*** strongholds being inaccessible except at low water and the ships being unable to navigate the shallow seas except at high water. Had Caesar written xxiv he would, as Heller says, have been giving his readers a piece of information which they must all have learnt at school, cf. Heller in Philologus xxxi p. 532 sqq."

The following explanation of these works is given by Napoleon after Goler. ***The Romans constructed at low water on the firm soil (of the promontory at the end of which the town was situated) two parallel moles serving at the same time as terraces and leading up to the town. During the course of their construction, the space comprised between these two moles was flooded at high water; but as soon as they succeeded in attaching these to the town, this space, into which the water could no longer penetrate, remained henceforward dry and offered to the besiegers a kind of parade-ground, from which to attack***. When the Romans had thus completed these preparations for attacking the town by land the enemy brought up their ships on the seaward side and removed themselves and their effects to another stronghold."
